How are cleanliness and environmental considerations addressed in our office?,"Document 1:---

**Snacks and more**

There will be beer, soda and snacks after All-hands presentations. 

On any other regular day:

- We might have chips etc, but op = op. We order snacks sometimes.
- This also goes for the cookies, fizzy drinks, beer or club mate.
- Fruit is something we want to provide everyday. If you notice we run out of fruit too fast and too often, ping our Office Manager so she can fix this.

If you are a big snack lover or don't want to be left empty-handed, consider bringing your own snacks.

**Clean up your shit**

You need to clean up your own shit. Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don't forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine. This 'system' works really well and keeps us away from bullshit like dishwasher duty.

Fahima is here every day, twice a day to clean this place, including toilets.

**Think about the environment.**

Kill the lights. Turn down the heating. Don't waste paper #deadtrees. We separate our garbage into paper, glass, plastics and rest. Don't waste food: feel free to take home bread on Friday.

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?lle is in charge of lunch ??ask her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

How do I file a complaint against a coworker?,"Document 1:# Addressing harassment

You are *always* in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward when you report an incident. We encourage you to talk about what happened.

If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8). In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it?s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. 

Here are the steps you can take, either:

- **Talk to the offender**. If you suspect that an offender doesn?t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.
Document 2:## **What you can expect from HR**

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.
Document 3:- Any form of harassment including bullying, intimidation, malicious gossip and victimisation of your colleagues, either inside or outside of the office.
- Any form of [sexual harassment](Sexual%20harassment%2069bffcbdaa6e4440b66be1239446c854.md), inside or outside of the office.
- Any use of drugs and alcohol during work.
- Use of drugs during Blendle outings and events, inside or outside of office barriers.
- If you show any unacceptable behaviour towards our guests.
- Stealing and fraud.
Document 4:Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behavior is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn?t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions.

If you suspect that someone doesn?t realize their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when:

- Your lead, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.

Content: Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behavior is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn?t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions.

If you suspect that someone doesn?t realize their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when:

- Your lead, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","To file a complaint against a coworker, you can take the following steps:

1. Talk to the offender: If you suspect that the offender may not realize they are guilty of harassment, you can directly talk to them to resolve the issue. This approach is suitable for cases of minor harassment.

2. Talk to your team lead: Explain the situation in detail to your team lead, who will assess the situation and may involve HR if necessary. If you have any evidence, such as emails, forward them or bring them to the meeting.

If the harassment involves sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favors under threats, it is advised to report it to HR and call the police to press charges.

Once a complaint is made, HR and the team lead will act immediately. You will remain in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. HR will inform you about the disciplinary procedures and your options, and they will launch a disciplinary process based on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or proven guilt in a court of law, the harasser will be terminated.

Why was my promotion denied?,"Document 1:# General disciplinary measures

Our Social code is crystal clear and very easily to follow. However, we also want to be clear about the consequences if for any reason you fail to follow the rules:

- **Verbal warning.** When we find it necessary to formally give you a warning. It might be a minor violation or your first time.
- **Official written warning**.  You will receive an official written warning for any serious breach of Blendle?s social code. This also applies when you already have had a maximum of two verbal warnings and your behavior hasn't improved. After 1 official written warning, we will move on to more serious measures like suspension or termination.
- **Suspension.** This happens when you have committed a very serious offense, or when we need time to investigate a case. Your access to Blendle will be temporarily revoked until it's clear whether and which measures should be taken.
- **Termination.** When the violation is of a very serious nature. These violations are most of the time determined by law and because of the severity of the act, we can terminate your contract immediately. Or, after an official written warning.

## When do we apply these measures

When we apply a measure, which measure we apply, and how long we apply it always depends on the situation and severity of the violation.

- Any form of harassment including bullying, intimidation, malicious gossip and victimisation of your colleagues, either inside or outside of the office.
Document 2:- Introduce your candidate by email to [People Operations or Recruitment](mailto:hr@blendle.com) and have them apply through Homerun.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

    - What impact do we expect this person to make in his/her - let's say - first 6 months?

    Sure, you are interviewing this person and it's your goal to be able to judge this person, but it's crucial you do this very subtly. Here are a few tips that might help.
    
    - **Let go of the structure.** Your a human, not a pre-programmed robot ;). Let the conversation happen and use the structure as a compass to make sure you cover everything. The most practical tip is to leave room for questions or to simply start explaining something from your side (just how you would do it when you're having a beer with someone). Try to feed information, even when you asked the questions up front and leave room for a question after that.
Document 4:- **Classic figures:** age, experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise.
        
        This is a bit old school, but also at Blendle there is a difference between someone who is 20 years of age with no experience or 30 with 8 years experience. For some jobs/roles we need certain skills, expertise or even education. This always comes with a price tag. 
        
    - **Scarcity & market value**
        
        It's fair to say that is harder to find an iOS engineer than an HR officer. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.
        
    - **Role and responsibilities**
        
        Certain roles and people make more impact then others. This is reflected in pay.
        
    - **Actual impact and contribution**
        
        Since we don't really like job titles, it's good to look at someones actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? 
        
    - **Someone's starting point**
        
        If we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.

    > Source to pin down your profile. New roles can be hard to pin down in a few bullet points. Since we can only hire (or turn down) someone if we know exactly what we are looking for, sourcing can be a good addition. Make a list of 20 people who match your profile so far on paper, ask your top 5 if they would like to have a cup of coffee with you. Use those conversations to finish your profile.

    Alright, so you came to the conclusion you need to hire someone. The next step is to pin down what you are (and aren't) exactly looking for in a candidate. This step is crucial. Rush this and you'll find yourself wobbling further down the road. 
    
    *Ask for help from recruitment/HR with this. They can help you out.*
    
    This set of questions should help you define your perfect candidate.
    
    - What team will the new person be joining? What is the goal of that team and how does that new person's job fit in there?
    - What problems are we aiming to solve by hiring this person? What would it look like when the problem is solved?
    - What impact do we expect this person to make in his/her - let's say - first 6 months?
    - What does good performance and success look like for this person? What do you expect from him/her?
    - What challenges or downsides does this role have?

    Sure, you are interviewing this person and it's your goal to be able to judge this person, but it's crucial you do this very subtly. Here are a few tips that might help.
    
    - **Let go of the structure.** Your a human, not a pre-programmed robot ;). Let the conversation happen and use the structure as a compass to make sure you cover everything. The most practical tip is to leave room for questions or to simply start explaining something from your side (just how you would do it when you're having a beer with someone). Try to feed information, even when you asked the questions up front and leave room for a question after that.

Content: - **Classic figures:** age, experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise.
        
        This is a bit old school, but also at Blendle there is a difference between someone who is 20 years of age with no experience or 30 with 8 years experience. For some jobs/roles we need certain skills, expertise or even education. This always comes with a price tag. 
        
    - **Scarcity & market value**
        
        It's fair to say that is harder to find an iOS engineer than an HR officer. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.
        
    - **Role and responsibilities**
        
        Certain roles and people make more impact then others. This is reflected in pay.
        
    - **Actual impact and contribution**
        
        Since we don't really like job titles, it's good to look at someones actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? 
        
    - **Someone's starting point**
        
        If we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.
        
    
    *Note: all of this is not an exact science and is determined together, so please: ask for help.*

What is the office environment like at Blendle?,"Document 1:# Office

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?lle is in charge of lunch ??ask her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

**Snacks and more**
Document 2:- **Blendle Premium:** 
we?ll hook you up with a Blendle Premium subscription.
- **Budget for study/courses/books/learning** etc.: 
there is money in our bank account and it?s up to us to spend it wisely. So yes, there is a budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable for Blendle to pitch in.
- **Blendle outings:** 
the party agenda is pretty full. You?ll be invited when there is a party ahead.
- **Flexible Holidays:** 
we think 4-6 weeks off per year is kinda the sweet spot, with at least once 2 weeks in a row. So that?s what we put in your contract.
- **Flexible hours**: 
we want you to find out what works for you best. Just know that we don't keep track of hours. We trust you.
- **Laptop**: 
we provide you with a laptop that suits your job. Ask HR for further info.
- **Workplace**: 
we've built a pretty nice office to make sure you like being at Blendle HQ. Feel free to sit where you want. Even better: dare to switch your workplace every once in a while.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Tough luck! Get over it! No, we care for each other so we will feel sorry for you. And everyone is willing to help out if you get in a tough spot being ill at home. To get the needed help or rest, just let your team lead know you?re staying at home (or going home).

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

",Good
What questions should be asked when defining the profile of the ideal candidate?,"Document 1:- What does good performance and success look like for this person? What do you expect from him/her?
    - What challenges or downsides does this role have?
    - What would you call the role? Is it an existing role (if yes: think if you can use someone as a blueprint, if no: make sure to check if our job title matches with other companies).
    - How much experience do you think this person needs? What kind and type of experience? In what kind and type of environments? Do you expect this person to be plug and play or is there room for learning and growing?
    - What could someone's career path look like at Blendle? What do we have to offer there?
    - Do you expect this person to lead a team or guild in a way?
    - What would a average week look like for this person?
    - What are examples of projects that were there the last quarter which could have been done by the new hire? What projects or topics are coming up?
    - What kind of skills, knowledge, expertise or experience does this person need? Make a distinction between must-haves and nice-to-haves. Be specific.
    - What kind of skills are lacking in the current team which this new person should bring?
    - Selling points: why would someone quit his job for this role? Think about the team, the role and Blendle.
    
    Share this with the hiring team, so everybody is on the same page on what we are looking for.
Document 2:Overall work questions:
    
    What was your biggest achievement at your former job? 
    
    What kind of things do you really dislike to do? Why? 
    
    What is your biggest mistake over the past year? What happened and how did you deal with it?
    
    You get to organise an event, which two/three people in your field of expertise would you invite to give a talk?
    
    What are your go-to platforms for staying up to date?
    
    What do you think your first 30 days would look like in this role?
    
    *Now try tailoring some questions to the profile you're looking for.*
    
    For example for PM's:
    
    What do you think Blendle's 3 most important metrics are?
    
    If you could make one change to Blendle's new iOS app, what would you change?
    
    What do you think of the current proposition?
    
    Do you communicate differently with designers than you do with engineers? What?s the difference?
    
    Can you give an example of a time where you had a hard time working with your team and how you fixed that?
    
    **Drive questions** (these apply to all roles)
    
    What makes you get up out of bed every morning? What makes you tick?
    
    If you would have your own company, what would it do/make/create?
    
    What kind of topics are you really passionate about? Sport, economics... 
    
    If you had no financial incentive (because you won the lottery) to work, how would you spend your days?
Document 3:? Check drive (is someone eager, ambitious and willing? Is someone motivated to work for Blendle?)
    
    ? Check fit (would someone fit in the current team and company? DNA/culture match?)
    
    *More on how to get answers on this in the block below (ask good questions).*
    
    **Practical questions (5 min)**
    
    ? Make sure there are no practical roadblocks like travel time, availability, money or working hours.
    
    **Outro (5 min)**
    
    ? Check if there are any more questions and tell candidate about the further process.
    
- **Ask good questions** (and listen).
    
    Asking good questions can be hard, so think about this when preparing your interview. This mainly applies to the section where you check work, drive and fit (also the three things you will be rating when making a decision).
    
    We recommend you come up with your own set and testing them out. What questions 'work' and which one don't? Share this with your hiring team! It's not per se a bad idea to ask the same kind of question to a person several times by several people. 
    
    Use the art of listening and follow up questions. Short questions like: can you elaborate on that? Why? Can you give an example? What effect did that have? How would you approach that situation now? What other options did you have? What happened? How? Can you explain?
    
    **Types of questions.** 
    
    There are different types of questions. Experiment with different types of questioning.
Document 4:Share this with the hiring team, so everybody is on the same page on what we are looking for.
    
    **When pinning down the profile, keep [the Matrix?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=1890661785) and Work, Drive and Fit in mind. That's also what your hiring team is going to rate the candidates on, so it's good to know what they have to be rating.** 
    
    If it's a new role, it can be hard to pin these questions down. You can use this set of questions to ask experts in the field to help you pin down the profile as described in the section '[Getting people in'](https://www.notion.so/beae540c6eb54f87b43bb2123d50f23e) section 3: Sourcing:
    
    > Source to pin down your profile. New roles can be hard to pin down in a few bullet points. Since we can only hire (or turn down) someone if we know exactly what we are looking for, sourcing can be a good addition. Make a list of 20 people who match your profile so far on paper, ask your top 5 if they would like to have a cup of coffee with you. Use those conversations to finish your profile.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

    - What challenges or downsides does this role have?
    - What would you call the role? Is it an existing role (if yes: think if you can use someone as a blueprint, if no: make sure to check if our job title matches with other companies).

    - Do you expect this person to lead a team or guild in a way?

    - What are examples of projects that were there the last quarter which could have been done by the new hire? What projects or topics are coming up?

    - What kind of skills are lacking in the current team which this new person should bring?
    - Selling points: why would someone quit his job for this role? Think about the team, the role and Blendle.

Content: Overall work questions:
    
    What was your biggest achievement at your former job? 
    
    What kind of things do you really dislike to do? Why? 
    
    What is your biggest mistake over the past year? What happened and how did you deal with it?
    
    You get to organise an event, which two/three people in your field of expertise would you invite to give a talk?
    
    What are your go-to platforms for staying up to date?
    
    What do you think your first 30 days would look like in this role?
    
    *Now try tailoring some questions to the profile you're looking for.*
    
    For example for PM's:
    
    What do you think Blendle's 3 most important metrics are?
    
    If you could make one change to Blendle's new iOS app, what would you change?
    
    What do you think of the current proposition?
    
    Do you communicate differently with designers than you do with engineers? What?s the difference?
    
    Can you give an example of a time where you had a hard time working with your team and how you fixed that?
    
    **Drive questions** (these apply to all roles)
    
    What makes you get up out of bed every morning? What makes you tick?
    
    If you would have your own company, what would it do/make/create?
    
    What kind of topics are you really passionate about? Sport, economics... 
    
    If you had no financial incentive (because you won the lottery) to work, how would you spend your days?

Content: ? Check drive (is someone eager, ambitious and willing? Is someone motivated to work for Blendle?)
    
    ? Check fit (would someone fit in the current team and company? DNA/culture match?)
    
    *More on how to get answers on this in the block below (ask good questions).*
    
    **Practical questions (5 min)**
    
    ? Make sure there are no practical roadblocks like travel time, availability, money or working hours.
    
    **Outro (5 min)**
    
    ? Check if there are any more questions and tell candidate about the further process.
    
- **Ask good questions** (and listen).
    
    Asking good questions can be hard, so think about this when preparing your interview. This mainly applies to the section where you check work, drive and fit (also the three things you will be rating when making a decision).
    
    We recommend you come up with your own set and testing them out. What questions 'work' and which one don't? Share this with your hiring team! It's not per se a bad idea to ask the same kind of question to a person several times by several people. 
    
    Use the art of listening and follow up questions. Short questions like: can you elaborate on that? Why? Can you give an example? What effect did that have? How would you approach that situation now? What other options did you have? What happened? How? Can you explain?
    
    **Types of questions.** 
    
    There are different types of questions. Experiment with different types of questioning.

    **When pinning down the profile, keep [the Matrix?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=1890661785) and Work, Drive and Fit in mind. That's also what your hiring team is going to rate the candidates on, so it's good to know what they have to be rating.** 
    
    If it's a new role, it can be hard to pin these questions down. You can use this set of questions to ask experts in the field to help you pin down the profile as described in the section '[Getting people in'](https://www.notion.so/beae540c6eb54f87b43bb2123d50f23e) section 3: Sourcing:
    
    > Source to pin down your profile. New roles can be hard to pin down in a few bullet points. Since we can only hire (or turn down) someone if we know exactly what we are looking for, sourcing can be a good addition. Make a list of 20 people who match your profile so far on paper, ask your top 5 if they would like to have a cup of coffee with you. Use those conversations to finish your profile.

What is the process for filing a formal grievance or appeal?,"Document 1:## **What you can expect from HR**

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.

Document 3:# General disciplinary measures

Our Social code is crystal clear and very easily to follow. However, we also want to be clear about the consequences if for any reason you fail to follow the rules:

- **Verbal warning.** When we find it necessary to formally give you a warning. It might be a minor violation or your first time.
- **Official written warning**.  You will receive an official written warning for any serious breach of Blendle?s social code. This also applies when you already have had a maximum of two verbal warnings and your behavior hasn't improved. After 1 official written warning, we will move on to more serious measures like suspension or termination.
- **Suspension.** This happens when you have committed a very serious offense, or when we need time to investigate a case. Your access to Blendle will be temporarily revoked until it's clear whether and which measures should be taken.
- **Termination.** When the violation is of a very serious nature. These violations are most of the time determined by law and because of the severity of the act, we can terminate your contract immediately. Or, after an official written warning.

## When do we apply these measures

When we apply a measure, which measure we apply, and how long we apply it always depends on the situation and severity of the violation.

- Any form of harassment including bullying, intimidation, malicious gossip and victimisation of your colleagues, either inside or outside of the office.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

3. Introduce yourself

**Google (G Suite)**

We use Google G Suite for email, calendars, spreadsheets and documents. We will set you up with a personal Google account (`[username]@blendle.com`), which is your identity within Blendle. You can use this account to sign in to both internal (e.g. 'goals', 'get-a-room') and external apps and services (through single sign-on).

# **Part 1: setting up your accounts and tools**

You can log in at: [http](https://www.google.com/a/blendle.com)[s[://www.google.com/a/blendle.com](https://www.google.com/a/blendle.com)

We use Slack for internal communication. This gives us all the ability to stalk each other,?use GIFs, work on Slack-bots, etc. etc. It comes as a web app, iOS app, Android App, OSX app and Windows app. Just download the apps for your platforms of choice. With [**this link](https://blendle.slack.com/signup)** you can create your own Slack account with your @blendle account (SSO for the win!). You can join all the relevant channels of your choice.

**Jira**

I?ve also sent you an invite (on your Blendle mail) for Jira. We use it for all sorts of things. Of course the occasional sprint planning but support uses it to flag issues and get them on sprints for example. Have a look around. When joining your team you?ll know soon enough which board to join.

Document 4:- You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.
    - This is a guideline.  If you have other national holidays you observe (eg Eid al-Fitr Suikerfeest, ending of Ramadan) feel free to work or be off when you want.
    
    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.
    - You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.
    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.
- **Backdrop**
    
    The law and additional ruling tell us what we can and can not do according to time off. We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:","Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer with references (""SOURCES"").

Content: - You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.
    - This is a guideline.  If you have other national holidays you observe (eg Eid al-Fitr Suikerfeest, ending of Ramadan) feel free to work or be off when you want.
    
    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.
    - You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.
    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.
- **Backdrop**
    
    The law and additional ruling tell us what we can and can not do according to time off. We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:

What are the reasons for off-cycle salary increases?,"Document 1:- **Off cycle salary increases**
    
    **Contract renewal** is not a moment that automatically means it is time to talk about money. We are not a company of people who demand *""give me X or I walk''*.  
    
    People can bring up salary any moment they want and we take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high) - see ""**How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?""**
    
    **Good reasons to raise offcycle**
    
    - Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.
    - Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone's impact and capabilities. It's important to be able to quantify that curve.
    - New information internally or externally.
    - New information by benchmarking studies or during hiring.
    
    **Not so good reasons to give a raise**
    
    - Colleague got another offer and uses this to get a raise.
    - 'I earn X for this company, that's a lot of money, I want a piece of the pie'.
    - Colleague just wants an incentive to stay. Money is never the answer, because it will fade - very - fast.
- **Control questions**
    
    Now before you finally decide
    
    - If we had to hire someone today for X's job, what would we pay them?
    - What would it cost Blendle as a business to find a new person (hard to replace, scarcity, time to hire, impact on day to day business & product)?
Document 2:- **Scarcity & market value.**
        
        It's fair to say that it's harder to fill some positions compared to some other roles. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.
        
    - **Role and responsibilities.**
        
        Certain roles and people make more impact than others. This is reflected in pay.
        
    - **Actual impact and contribution**
        
        Since we don't really like job titles, it's good to look at someone's actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? Can we try to put that in numbers or concrete projects?
        
    - **Someone's starting point**
        
        If we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.
        
    
    *Note: all of this is not an exact science and is determined together, so please: ask for help.*
    
- **When do we talk about money?**
    - **Yearly company wide salary raises in January**
        
        Every year (in January) we take a good look at all the salaries at Cafeyn- Blendle. Right after the feedback cycle (which we use as input) we have salary talks with everyone. We chose to do this once a year so we don't have a constant conversation about money through the year.
        
- **Off cycle salary increases**
Document 3:# Salary Review

- **How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?**
    
    We weigh up several variables:
    
    - **Benchmark:** internal and external.
        
        The most accurate way to determine the range where someone should be is comparing someone with a peer internally. During the hiring process you find out at what level someone is and you'll be able to compare him or her internally. Who would you compare this person to in terms of level? Is he/she better than X? If you notice that everyone is not as good as the people we have, but are paid more: think about raising the salary of our people. Keep in mind that - especially in tech - the market is on tilt. Big corporate pay a lot of money to even mediocare people in tech. We don't want to compete with them and that is a choice for new hires to make. 
        
    - **Classic figures:** experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise.
        
        This is a bit old school in a way, but also at Blendle there is a difference between someone who is a starter with no experience or someone with 8 years of experience. For some jobs/roles we need certain skills, expertise or even education. This always comes with a price tag. 
        
    - **Scarcity & market value.**
Document 4:- When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.
- When people work hard, **poke them** to take time off so they recharge.
- For longer leaves of absence (~4 weeks) ping HR for advice.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

FINAL ANSWER:","The reasons for off-cycle salary increases include drastic changes in role and responsibilities, a steep learning curve that makes current pay unfair, new information internally or externally, and new information from benchmarking studies or during hiring. However, giving a raise because a colleague got another offer, wanting a piece of the pie, or just wanting an incentive to stay are not considered good reasons. Other factors that determine someone's salary include scarcity and market value, role and responsibilities, actual impact and contribution, and someone's starting point. Salary determinations are based on benchmarking, classic figures such as experience and education, and market value. Salary talks typically occur yearly in January, but off-cycle salary increases can be discussed if necessary.

This email will  be sent to your private email address. Via this email you'll get access to [Salarisbalie portal](https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/applications/Common/Login) (which runs on the tool NMBRS) where you can see your monthly payslip and your annual salary overview.
Document 3:# People System - Salarisbalie - Requesting Time off & Expensing

Salarisbalie is our payroll specialist and makes sure we get paid correctly every month, Salarisbalie works within a tool called NMBRS. NMBRS is used for saving and monitoring all personnel files,  personal information, holidays, dossiers, contracts, etc. 

When you start at Blendle, you get onboarded in this system. Easy peasy, everything in one place. 

You, HR and your lead have access to this self service tool.

So what can you do with Nmbrs?   Next to accessing your personal information and contracts, you can also change your contact information yourself. Plus, requesting time off and claiming expenses just became a whole lot easier: 

- **Time off request**
    
    **Why are we doing this if we have unlimited holidays?**
    The ""unlimited fair use"" rule stays. We are adding the balance for legal reasons. 
    
    And while we don't have a maximum, we do have a **minimum** that we want you to take, to keep you healthy - 20 days each year, for a 40 hour contract. 
    
    Plus, NMBRS has a super easy way to overview who is out of office and when, Blendle wide.  A great tool for teams and managers to plan work and availability especially around big projects or releases.
    
    **It looks weird in the system.....I see a negative balance!**
Document 4:People team uses this system to save and track all your personal documents and information as well. Whenever something changes, this will go through this system. You can change your contact information and address if you move. You can also always access this system to have a look at your documents, eg contract, reviews etc.

You can also send in your requests for reimbursement of business expenses and holidays.   

**Security**

We care about security. So, whenever possible (Google apps, GitHub etc): use two-factor authentication! And please turn on Full Disk Encryption (FileVault on Mac) on your computer. And of course, whether you're at the office or somewhere else,?be sure to lock your computer whenever you are AFK. And whenever you hear ?Brace, Brace!?, be sure to get yourself into brace-position. It is for your own and our safety. :-)

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Salarisbalie is our payroll specialist and makes sure we get paid correctly every month, Salarisbalie works within a tool called NMBRS. NMBRS is used for saving and monitoring all personnel files,  personal information, holidays, dossiers, contracts, etc. 

When you start at Blendle, you get onboarded in this system. Easy peasy, everything in one place. 

You, HR and your lead have access to this self service tool.

So what can you do with Nmbrs?   Next to accessing your personal information and contracts, you can also change your contact information yourself. Plus, requesting time off and claiming expenses just became a whole lot easier: 

- **Time off request**
    
    **Why are we doing this if we have unlimited holidays?**
    The ""unlimited fair use"" rule stays. We are adding the balance for legal reasons. 
    
    And while we don't have a maximum, we do have a **minimum** that we want you to take, to keep you healthy - 20 days each year, for a 40 hour contract. 
    
    Plus, NMBRS has a super easy way to overview who is out of office and when, Blendle wide.  A great tool for teams and managers to plan work and availability especially around big projects or releases.
    
    **It looks weird in the system.....I see a negative balance!**

What observations has Blendle made regarding its current diversity profile?,"Document 1:- We believe being **inclusive** is important because it **fits our core values** of wanting to be a great place to work and really caring for each other. A place where people feel welcome and can be themselves. Inclusivity is crucial to our work environment and culture.
- We have trouble hiring diverse profiles. We noticed no flaws in the hiring process which would lead to favour a certain type of profile. We did notice that the 'pools' in which we are hiring (journalism and tech) are dominated by a certain profile which could explain this trend.
- We have open-minded people at Blendle who are willing and are becoming more aware.

**Some observations**:

- We tend to speak in Dutch in social settings. It can easily make non-Dutch people uncomfortable. We should speak English.
- The way we work (especially in meetings) suits extravert people better then introvert people.
- There is not a lot of variation on standard diversity variables like political views, religion, age, ethnicity, gender and educational background. Again, partly explained by the field we're in.
- Most of the leaders at Blendle are male.
- There is equal pay between men and women in the same role.
- We believe aiming for diversity numbers narrows the conversation on the topic for now. We decided to use the data to feed the conversation but not implement quotas.

Document 2:# Diversity and Inclusion

It was this ^^ picture from our Christmas party three years ago which got us some replies on Twitter. A lot of males and a lot of white. We know that we need to do better to make Blendle a more diverse workplace. We spend a lot of time thinking about diversity and inclusion. After reading, talking and listening, we learned a few things:

- This is a sensitive topic: feelings and opinions are involved.
- This is a trending topic: there is a lot of noise and it's hard to pin down the essence.
- This is not a new, but renewed topic.
- Diversity and inclusion is more of a scale than a simple yes or no statement.
- Everyone is biased and every company is at risk of becoming less diverse and inclusive.
- A more diverse and inclusive company **>** a less diverse and inclusive company for a lot of reasons.
- Diversity and inclusion is not 'just' about gender or race, so looking at just those numbers can limit your thoughts on this topic. The practical side of this topic is also way more subtle.

**Diversity and inclusion at Blendle**

What we know now:

- We believe in the importance of a **diverse** team because we believe **it's crucial to our succes and product.** We try to add meaning to peoples everyday life by helping them reach quality content instead of cat gifs on Facebook. This can only be done by a group of people with different backgrounds, expertise, personalities, talents, ideas and opinions.

[How to Talk About Sexual Harassment](https://leanin.org/meeting-guides/how-to-talk-about-sexual-harassment)

We were inspired after reading this example from Workable and used that as a starting point for this document.

[Employee Code of Conduct Company Policy Template](https://resources.workable.com/employee-code-of-conduct-company-policy)
Document 4:Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behavior is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn?t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions.

If you suspect that someone doesn?t realize their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when:

- Your lead, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

    3. Adjust the job description to your liking:

        - The second section consists of the 4-5 reasons we chose to work at Blendle. You can alter them, but you can keep those the same.
        - The third section is our wishlist: alter these to get the most important stuff from your intake (above) across.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

What are some concrete actions I can take to improve the vibe during a sprint?,"Document 1:# What can I do

**Good news:** you can do something.

# 1. Check yourself:

When looking at all the things stated in chapter 3, you might recognize some stuff. In addition you can fill in this self test: 

[Burnout Self-Test: Are You at Risk?](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTCS_08.htm)

So how are you?

[]()

- I'm good!
    
    Great, take some time to realize why you are doing fine and take measures in order to prevent yourself from getting to stressed.
    
- I?m okay-ish, but something needs to change.
    - Start by telling your team lead that you feel like you have been on your toes for a while and you think you need time to recover. Also tell your team. Also tell HR.
    - Come up with a concrete 2 week plan (we can help you with that) to release some of the first pressure. This will mean a less busy sprint, shorter days, and maybe 2 weeks of 4 days to start with (or a holiday). The hours you gain, you can spend on things you enjoy and help you reload (Netflix, sports, cinema, go to the beach, visit friends, play with model trains). We learned that just doing nothing, doesn?t always help, so make sure to spend time on things you like.
    - During these two weeks you check in with your team lead how your stress level is. You can make it really concrete by giving your stress level a number (1-10).
Document 2:When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:
    
    - **It is impossible to work 60 hours productively over a longer period of time.** It hurts you and Blendle to work that much. If you are able to work 8 productive hours a day you should be proud of that. Sometimes it will be 6, sometimes 10: relax, it?s okay, You?re not working in a factory with time stamps.
    - Be flexible. Some days you just don?t have it. **You are not a machine.** Of course, first you?ll take a walk and grab a double espresso or a Club Mate, but if that doesn?t work it?s okay. Go home. Go to the gym. Go play with your kid. Go kiting. Go for a walk in the forest. Anything, just don?t sit behind your desk to ?make the hours?. That?s not helping anybody.
    - Working at home vs. at Blendle HQ. Try to strike a **balance between home/office**. Meetings and brainstorms are best done face to face but a day of deep work is best done in a cafe or on an abandoned island with 4g.
    - **Rotate, change your pace.** During the summer it can be nice to start at 6:30 and bike to the beach at 15.00h. During the winter, every morning might feel like a small hangover and you stroll into HQ at 10:00 after your first 2 cups of coffee.
- **Take care of your body and mind**
    
    
    **Take holidays and days off.**
Document 3:We know this adds to your tally. Again, just becoming aware of this already helps.

And also again, when you see something causing a lot of stress, let?s get to work on it. Not digging the new team structure? Not feeling your current role? Not happy with your team lead? Bring it up with someone you trust (HR, your team lead, Alexander, just anyone) and let?s try to fix it or at least talk about it.

Blendle cares. We care. So if you?re struggling, let?s change things to make sure you are happy, healthy and at your best.

# 3. Make changes: here are some quick wins

- **Look at your work life balance**
    
    
    > In engineering, people talk about asset integrity, which means that you service the machinery before it breaks. In modern organizations, the work is thinking and the machinery is your brain. We know from cognitive science that there are hard limits to what the brain can deal with. And yet, there?s an awful lot in the way we work which flies in the face of that. We think that if we work through the night, we?re being very clever. We?re not. We think we can work long hours ? month after month, year after year ? and that there won?t be any wear and tear. But there is.

Document 4:- **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: What are some concrete actions I can take to improve the vibe during a sprint?
=========
Content: # What can I do

**Good news:** you can do something.

# 1. Check yourself:

When looking at all the things stated in chapter 3, you might recognize some stuff. In addition you can fill in this self test: 

[Burnout Self-Test: Are You at Risk?](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTCS_08.htm)

So how are you?

[]()

- I'm good!
    
    Great, take some time to realize why you are doing fine and take measures in order to prevent yourself from getting to stressed.
    
- I?m okay-ish, but something needs to change.
    - Start by telling your team lead that you feel like you have been on your toes for a while and you think you need time to recover. Also tell your team. Also tell HR.
    - Come up with a concrete 2 week plan (we can help you with that) to release some of the first pressure. This will mean a less busy sprint, shorter days, and maybe 2 weeks of 4 days to start with (or a holiday). The hours you gain, you can spend on things you enjoy and help you reload (Netflix, sports, cinema, go to the beach, visit friends, play with model trains). We learned that just doing nothing, doesn?t always help, so make sure to spend time on things you like.
    - During these two weeks you check in with your team lead how your stress level is. You can make it really concrete by giving your stress level a number (1-10).

Content: When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:
    
    - **It is impossible to work 60 hours productively over a longer period of time.** It hurts you and Blendle to work that much. If you are able to work 8 productive hours a day you should be proud of that. Sometimes it will be 6, sometimes 10: relax, it?s okay, You?re not working in a factory with time stamps.
    - Be flexible. Some days you just don?t have it. **You are not a machine.** Of course, first you?ll take a walk and grab a double espresso or a Club Mate, but if that doesn?t work it?s okay. Go home. Go to the gym. Go play with your kid. Go kiting. Go for a walk in the forest. Anything, just don?t sit behind your desk to ?make the hours?. That?s not helping anybody.
    - Working at home vs. at Blendle HQ. Try to strike a **balance between home/office**. Meetings and brainstorms are best done face to face but a day of deep work is best done in a cafe or on an abandoned island with 4g.
    - **Rotate, change your pace.** During the summer it can be nice to start at 6:30 and bike to the beach at 15.00h. During the winter, every morning might feel like a small hangover and you stroll into HQ at 10:00 after your first 2 cups of coffee.
- **Take care of your body and mind**
    
    
    **Take holidays and days off.**

Content: We know this adds to your tally. Again, just becoming aware of this already helps.

And also again, when you see something causing a lot of stress, let?s get to work on it. Not digging the new team structure? Not feeling your current role? Not happy with your team lead? Bring it up with someone you trust (HR, your team lead, Alexander, just anyone) and let?s try to fix it or at least talk about it.

Blendle cares. We care. So if you?re struggling, let?s change things to make sure you are happy, healthy and at your best.

# 3. Make changes: here are some quick wins

- **Look at your work life balance**
    
    
    > In engineering, people talk about asset integrity, which means that you service the machinery before it breaks. In modern organizations, the work is thinking and the machinery is your brain. We know from cognitive science that there are hard limits to what the brain can deal with. And yet, there?s an awful lot in the way we work which flies in the face of that. We think that if we work through the night, we?re being very clever. We?re not. We think we can work long hours ? month after month, year after year ? and that there won?t be any wear and tear. But there is.

Content: - **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?
    
    Are you giving praise?
    
    Are you actively challenging your team?
    
    Are you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?
    
    Are you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?
    
    Is your schedule (and that of your team) in a healthy rhythm (work-life balance)? You set the example.
    
    Is your team taking regular holidays/long weekends?

    Yes, as we now know there is a lot more to it than just taking holidays and working less. You could still feel stressed working 20 hours. Looking at the time spent on work and time spent on your personal life is a pretty good start and good for everybody (also when you don?t feel stressed. Let?s try to prevent it).

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","Some situations that might indicate someone is underperforming include low energy and lack of motivation, not enjoying their work, experiencing depressing and anxious thoughts, physical manifestations of stress, trouble remembering things, and an increase in compulsive behavior. In the workplace, indicators of underperformance may include poor work-life balance, dissatisfaction with the direction of the company, lack of time for recovery, strained relationships with colleagues and team leads, lack of influence and freedom in their work, and feeling that their work does not matter or have impact. It is important for leaders to actively think about the possibility of underperformance, flag it to HR or management, analyze the problem and provide feedback, and offer help if needed. It is also important to address any instances of harassment or mistreatment in the workplace.

Is there food in the office?,"Document 1:# Office

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?lle is in charge of lunch ??ask her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

---

**Snacks and more**
Document 2:---

**Snacks and more**

There will be beer, soda and snacks after All-hands presentations. 

On any other regular day:

- We might have chips etc, but op = op. We order snacks sometimes.
- This also goes for the cookies, fizzy drinks, beer or club mate.
- Fruit is something we want to provide everyday. If you notice we run out of fruit too fast and too often, ping our Office Manager so she can fix this.

If you are a big snack lover or don't want to be left empty-handed, consider bringing your own snacks.

---

**Clean up your shit**

You need to clean up your own shit. Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don't forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine. This 'system' works really well and keeps us away from bullshit like dishwasher duty.

Fahima is here every day, twice a day to clean this place, including toilets. 

---

**Think about the environment.**

Kill the lights. Turn down the heating. Don't waste paper #deadtrees. We separate our garbage into paper, glass, plastics and rest. Don't waste food: feel free to take home bread on Friday.

Document 3:**Headspace**

To keep your head in shape, we pay for the best apps to help you do so: Headspace to stay calm and mindful and **Things** to boost your productivity and help you reach your goals. Blendle offers reimbursement on your Headspace subscription.

**Lunch**

At Blendle we tend to lunch together. Buurtboer arranges nice lunches including sandwiches (to be self-made), salad, eggs and veggies. Just get your plate, walk to the salad bar (yes we got a salad bar from Marktplaats for 100 euros), grab whatever you like and enjoy the company of your colleagues (or don?t, whatever). Any allergies or preferences? Let us know at [officemanagement@blendle.com](mailto:officemanagement@blendle.com).

Don?t be afraid to help out on cleaning up after lunch. You?ll experience this thing called gratitude if you do?

**[Sick](Calling%20in%20sick%20better%20ca3c036d25a24fcf988c410c9fc67108.md)?**

Tough luck! Get over it! No, we care for each other so we will feel sorry for you. And everyone is willing to help out if you get in a tough spot being ill at home. To get the needed help or rest, just let your team lead know you?re staying at home (or going home).

**Official Holidays and Vacay!**
Document 4:**Food and exercise**
    
    Crucial to feeling well, is taking care of your body. Studies show that exercise is crucial when having a demanding job. That doesn?t mean we want you all to be fitgirls and fitboys. But: get moving. Go skating, hiking, biking, surfing, do yoga. Do something. Your body isn?t made to sit in a chair all day. Use the facilities at the office (standing desks and desk bikes) and try to go for a walk every day (is the 1on1-walk a thing yet?). The things you consume also affect this of course, no secrets there. Take care of yourself by consuming good stuff. No rocket science: just more veggies and water, less alcohol and smoking. Take care of yourself.
    
    **When something is wrong: go see a doctor:**
    
    Don?t wait too long to go see a doctor or therapist. It?s very normal to talk to a psychologist or coach every once in awhile. Just as normal as visiting a physiotherapist for back pain because you have an office job.
    
- **Setting priorities right and saying no (I know this is hard)**
    
    
    1. You, your family, friends and loved ones
    2. Blendle
    
    It?s important to know what the right order is. Your health comes first. Your loved ones come first. We want you to pay attention to your number 1 priority and have your private life in order. Because if it?s not, it will add to your stress level.","Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer with references (""SOURCES"").

- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

**Snacks and more**

**Snacks and more**

There will be beer, soda and snacks after All-hands presentations. 

On any other regular day:

- We might have chips etc, but op = op. We order snacks sometimes.
- This also goes for the cookies, fizzy drinks, beer or club mate.
- Fruit is something we want to provide everyday. If you notice we run out of fruit too fast and too often, ping our Office Manager so she can fix this.

If you are a big snack lover or don't want to be left empty-handed, consider bringing your own snacks.

**Clean up your shit**

You need to clean up your own shit. Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don't forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine. This 'system' works really well and keeps us away from bullshit like dishwasher duty.

Fahima is here every day, twice a day to clean this place, including toilets.

**Think about the environment.**

Kill the lights. Turn down the heating. Don't waste paper #deadtrees. We separate our garbage into paper, glass, plastics and rest. Don't waste food: feel free to take home bread on Friday.

Content: **Headspace**

To keep your head in shape, we pay for the best apps to help you do so: Headspace to stay calm and mindful and **Things** to boost your productivity and help you reach your goals. Blendle offers reimbursement on your Headspace subscription. Leave your name [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-zlsECyft1A7SV30dsbaxGeS7F66u2Yte7sOli8bc4k/edit?ts=5ae08e58#gid=0) and you will receive a monthly reimbursement together with your salary.

**Lunch**

At Blendle we tend to lunch together. Buurtboer arranges nice lunches including sandwiches (to be self-made), salad, eggs and veggies. Just get your plate, walk to the salad bar (yes we got a salad bar from Marktplaats for 100 euros), grab whatever you like and enjoy the company of your colleagues (or don?t, whatever). Any allergies or preferences? Let us know at [officemanagement@blendle.com](mailto:officemanagement@blendle.com).

Don?t be afraid to help out on cleaning up after lunch. You?ll experience this thing called gratitude if you do?

**[Sick](Calling%20in%20sick%20better%20ca3c036d25a24fcf988c410c9fc67108.md)?**

Tough luck! Get over it! No, we care for each other so we will feel sorry for you. And everyone is willing to help out if you get in a tough spot being ill at home. To get the needed help or rest, just let your team lead know you?re staying at home (or going home).

**Official Holidays and Vacay!**

Content: **Food and exercise**
    
    Crucial to feeling well, is taking care of your body. Studies show that exercise is crucial when having a demanding job. That doesn?t mean we want you all to be fitgirls and fitboys. But: get moving. Go skating, hiking, biking, surfing, do yoga. Do something. Your body isn?t made to sit in a chair all day. Use the facilities at the office (standing desks and desk bikes) and try to go for a walk every day (is the 1on1-walk a thing yet?). The things you consume also affect this of course, no secrets there. Take care of yourself by consuming good stuff. No rocket science: just more veggies and water, less alcohol and smoking. Take care of yourself.
    
    **When something is wrong: go see a doctor:**
    
    Don?t wait too long to go see a doctor or therapist. It?s very normal to talk to a psychologist or coach every once in awhile. Just as normal as visiting a physiotherapist for back pain because you have an office job.
    
- **Setting priorities right and saying no (I know this is hard)**
    
    
    1. You, your family, friends and loved ones
    2. Blendle
    
    It?s important to know what the right order is. Your health comes first. Your loved ones come first. We want you to pay attention to your number 1 priority and have your private life in order. Because if it?s not, it will add to your stress level.

Document 2:- **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?
    
    Are you giving praise?
    
    Are you actively challenging your team?
    
    Are you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?
    
    Are you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?
    
    Is your schedule (and that of your team) in a healthy rhythm (work-life balance)? You set the example.
    
    Is your team taking regular holidays/long weekends?

Document 3:Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :). 
    

## Here's what you can do:

1. Actively **think** about the possibility that someone's time at Blendle is up. At least every month for everyone in your team.
2. **Flag** this at HR/MT when that happens. 
3. **Ask** for help if needed already at this stage.
4. **Analyse** (maybe together) the problem and give feedback to the person in question: try to get on the same page about where things go 'wrong'. These are pointers which might steer your thoughts. Real situations are always more complex. 
    - Someone is **underperforming**. Try using [the Matrix?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=0) to track down the areas where you think things should improve. Give actionable feedback and try to come up with concrete points to work on in his/her personal goals. Don't wait for the feedback cycle, the time is always now.
    - Someone **stopped growing or learning**. This isn't necessarily an immediate problem, but it can be because most people like working at Blendle because they grow and learn so much. Someone standing still for a year is a red flag.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Document 2:# What can Blendle do?

There?s a lot Blendle could improve and we?re working on that. The fact that we are a fast-paced startup with an aim to save journalism is not something that will change any time soon. This also means that we are facing a runway, which affects our everyday work. This is fuelling us to go the extra mile, but the downsides are also obvious.

So what can Blendle do?

- **Voicing vision & mission more:** everybody should feel connected to where Blendle is going and why. Talking about this more will help everybody align. This way everybody has more influence on the direction and it is more clear why a change of direction is made and how this affects your work.
- Open channels: **work on transparency and trust**: everybody should be able to speak up if they feel that the stress level is too high. Also when someone feels like they aren?t in the right role or simply doing work they don?t love everyday.
- **Build an environment which is less stressful.** This piece is step 1 on this point. Notice when people work too much. Tell people if we notice it and tell them to take action (go home, take holiday, work less, talk to someone). Let?s also keep improving the process we have in place for when people feel it?s too much.
Document 3:# Firing

Saying goodbye to Blendle (from a colleague) and to a colleague (from Blendle) is a very normal and natural thing. When done right, it can even be a beautiful thing. 

We advise you to read the backdrop below first, but feel free to jump in right away with the 'Here's what you can do'-section :). General note: you do not have to do this alone, so please ask for advice and help!

- **Backdrop**
    
    Saying goodbye to Blendle (from a colleague) and to a colleague (from Blendle) is a very normal and natural thing. When done right, it can even be a beautiful thing.
    
    Saying goodbye to people is also an important part of keeping your team on the right track. Firing can even be a part of your [Personnel Planning](Hiring%20fd6a5e1f88dd4476988147a3a62e1f0d.md). The most common situation will be when you think someone is no longer a good match with Blendle for whatever reason. This doesn't happen overnight, so try to spot situations where this is happening. 
    
    To make things clear: HR and Rick and Alex will help you with this, but we want this to be on your agenda. HR will take care of the process and paper- and legal work. Rick and Alex will help with the tough conversations. **The most important work happens months before that and that's where you come in.**

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.

QUESTION: What is the importance of building relationships with colleagues at Blendle?
=========
Content: - **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?
    
    Are you giving praise?
    
    Are you actively challenging your team?
    
    Are you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?
    
    Are you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?
    
    Is your schedule (and that of your team) in a healthy rhythm (work-life balance)? You set the example.
    
    Is your team taking regular holidays/long weekends?

Content: # What can Blendle do?

There?s a lot Blendle could improve and we?re working on that. The fact that we are a fast-paced startup with an aim to save journalism is not something that will change any time soon. This also means that we are facing a runway, which affects our everyday work. This is fuelling us to go the extra mile, but the downsides are also obvious.

So what can Blendle do?

- **Voicing vision & mission more:** everybody should feel connected to where Blendle is going and why. Talking about this more will help everybody align. This way everybody has more influence on the direction and it is more clear why a change of direction is made and how this affects your work.
- Open channels: **work on transparency and trust**: everybody should be able to speak up if they feel that the stress level is too high. Also when someone feels like they aren?t in the right role or simply doing work they don?t love everyday.
- **Build an environment which is less stressful.** This piece is step 1 on this point. Notice when people work too much. Tell people if we notice it and tell them to take action (go home, take holiday, work less, talk to someone). Let?s also keep improving the process we have in place for when people feel it?s too much.

Saying goodbye to Blendle (from a colleague) and to a colleague (from Blendle) is a very normal and natural thing. When done right, it can even be a beautiful thing. 

We advise you to read the backdrop below first, but feel free to jump in right away with the 'Here's what you can do'-section :). General note: you do not have to do this alone, so please ask for advice and help!

    Saying goodbye to Blendle (from a colleague) and to a colleague (from Blendle) is a very normal and natural thing. When done right, it can even be a beautiful thing.

The most common situation will be when you think someone is no longer a good match with Blendle for whatever reason. This doesn't happen overnight, so try to spot situations where this is happening. 
    
    To make things clear: HR and Rick and Alex will help you with this, but we want this to be on your agenda. HR will take care of the process and paper- and legal work. Rick and Alex will help with the tough conversations. **The most important work happens months before that and that's where you come in.**

FINAL ANSWER:","Building relationships with colleagues at Blendle is important for several reasons. It helps to keep jobs fun and allows people to work on things they love and are good at. It also promotes education and helps individuals regulate their work better, reducing stress. Feedback and praise are important aspects of building relationships, as well as creating awareness within teams and team leads.

## Here's what you can do:

1. Actively **think** about the possibility that someone's time at Blendle is up. At least every month for everyone in your team.
2. **Flag** this at HR/MT when that happens. 
3. **Ask** for help if needed already at this stage.
4. **Analyse** (maybe together) the problem and give feedback to the person in question: try to get on the same page about where things go 'wrong'. These are pointers which might steer your thoughts. Real situations are always more complex. 
    - Someone is **underperforming**. Try using [the Matrix?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=0) to track down the areas where you think things should improve. Give actionable feedback and try to come up with concrete points to work on in his/her personal goals. Don't wait for the feedback cycle, the time is always now.
    - Someone **stopped growing or learning**. This isn't necessarily an immediate problem, but it can be because most people like working at Blendle because they grow and learn so much. Someone standing still for a year is a red flag.
Document 2:- Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

Bring it up with someone you trust (HR, your team lead, Alexander, just anyone) and let?s try to fix it or at least talk about it.

Blendle cares. We care. So if you?re struggling, let?s change things to make sure you are happy, healthy and at your best.

# 3. Make changes: here are some quick wins

- **Look at your work life balance**
    
    
    > In engineering, people talk about asset integrity, which means that you service the machinery before it breaks. In modern organizations, the work is thinking and the machinery is your brain. We know from cognitive science that there are hard limits to what the brain can deal with. And yet, there?s an awful lot in the way we work which flies in the face of that. We think that if we work through the night, we?re being very clever. We?re not. We think we can work long hours ? month after month, year after year ? and that there won?t be any wear and tear. But there is.

Bring it up with someone you trust (HR, your team lead, Alexander, just anyone) and let?s try to fix it or at least talk about it.

Blendle cares. We care. So if you?re struggling, let?s change things to make sure you are happy, healthy and at your best.

# 3. Make changes: here are some quick wins

- **Look at your work life balance**
    
    
    > In engineering, people talk about asset integrity, which means that you service the machinery before it breaks. In modern organizations, the work is thinking and the machinery is your brain. We know from cognitive science that there are hard limits to what the brain can deal with. And yet, there?s an awful lot in the way we work which flies in the face of that. We think that if we work through the night, we?re being very clever. We?re not. We think we can work long hours ? month after month, year after year ? and that there won?t be any wear and tear. But there is.

Content: - **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?
    
    Are you giving praise?
    
    Are you actively challenging your team?
    
    Are you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?
    
    Are you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?
    
    Is your schedule (and that of your team) in a healthy rhythm (work-life balance)? You set the example.
    
    Is your team taking regular holidays/long weekends?
    
    Here?s an article about how to help your team with this:

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","Team leads can help employees who have stopped growing or learning by actively thinking about the possibility that someone's time at the company is up, flagging this to HR/MT, analyzing the problem and giving feedback to the person, trying to fix it together, and finishing it up on time if the situation is not progressing. They can also make changes such as looking at work-life balance, keeping jobs fun, educating employees on work regulation methods, providing feedback and praise, and creating awareness within teams and team leads.",Good
What is the purpose of the trial period for new hires at Blendle?,"Document 1:# Your 1st month

Hey you! Welcome to Blendle. Buckle up, you're in for one hell of a ride :). 

The faster you get settled in the better, so we came up with a structure for your first month to make sure you have a smooth start.

- **Structure 1st month**
    
    Your first month is officially your trial period, which means both parties can terminate the contract if we figure out it is a total mismatch. In Blendle history, this happened once. Your first month is **not** an extended hiring process. As you might have noticed, the hiring process was pretty thorough and you made it through. This means we are pretty sure this is a good match. But, life happens so it's good to have a safeguard like the trial period, just don't feel any extra pressure plz.
    
    - **Before day 1:** your contract is signed and all the administrative stuff is taken care of. After that you got your on-boarding e-mail which probably led you here. This e-mail contains all the basic knowledge and acces codes to get you going.
    - **Day 1:** **Start** around 10:00 (depending on your team, check with them), receive your laptop and Blendle stuff, get settled in (where is the toilet, how does the coffee machine work). Your buddy will get you started in terms of work.
        
        Check this page to get up to speed on the basics: 
        
        [YOUR first week x](YOUR%20first%20week%20x%20940621ae57e54c39aa5ded6e1b49cf4d.md)
Document 2:- **Blendle Premium:** 
we?ll hook you up with a Blendle Premium subscription.
- **Budget for study/courses/books/learning** etc.: 
there is money in our bank account and it?s up to us to spend it wisely. So yes, there is a budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable for Blendle to pitch in.
- **Blendle outings:** 
the party agenda is pretty full. You?ll be invited when there is a party ahead.
- **Flexible Holidays:** 
we think 4-6 weeks off per year is kinda the sweet spot, with at least once 2 weeks in a row. So that?s what we put in your contract.
- **Flexible hours**: 
we want you to find out what works for you best. Just know that we don't keep track of hours. We trust you.
- **Laptop**: 
we provide you with a laptop that suits your job. Ask HR for further info.
- **Workplace**: 
we've built a pretty nice office to make sure you like being at Blendle HQ. Feel free to sit where you want. Even better: dare to switch your workplace every once in a while.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Document 2:# Parenthood

Being or becoming a parent can be challenging at home and at work. No matter if you are already a parent or are going to be one, you might have some questions about what Blendle has in place for Blendle moms and dads. This page should contain all the information you seek.j

- **Maternity leave**
    
    When you're pregnant, we recommend you inform your lead and HR no later than 3 months before your due date. This way we have enough time for the necessary paperwork with UWV. We also need a pregnancy statement from your doctor with the due date.
    
    **Some practical info:**
    
    1. Absence during pregnancy:
        
        If you happen to get ill because of your pregnancy or if you have to be absent because of doctor appointments, please inform your lead. Our general guidelines on [Holidays](Holidays%20x%205b552479e5ad40b49ce71fa68840ce35.md) and [Sickness](Sickness%20absence%204ee2e3c7281546d3a827de3e3e286366.md) absence also apply in this case.
        
    2. Salary:
        
        Nothing changes here. Blendle pays your full salary.
        
    3. Duration of maternity leave:
Document 3:**Important note?** You won't be getting salary and other allowances during the parental leave. And technically, you are not saving up for holiday hours and you are not saving up for holiday allowance.
    
    Please let your lead and HR know if you are planning to take parental leave. HR can help you with all your questions.
Document 4:3. Within 4 weeks after birth:
        - Inform HR of the birth date
        - Let your lead and HR know if you need anything when you are back at work
    
- **Birth leave**
    
    As a partner (if you are not the one giving birth) you are also entitled to leave after the birth of your child. The official term for this is birth leave.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

What is the purpose of upward feedback?,"Document 1:?In other words, I would tell the manager what everybody said but not who said it. Not because I wanted to foster secrecy, but because I wanted to help get the information out there,? says Scott. ?If there were too many things the team didn?t feel comfortable saying directly to their boss, and if it wasn?t getting better over time, that became the top thing I worked with the manager to change.?

    Just let us know if you would like one and we will organize it for you :).
    
    **Upward feedback**
    
    Something you can do yourself is asking for upward feedback using a typeform/googleform. Send these questions to your team and see where you're at:
    
    - My teamlead regularly gives me actionable feedback that helps me improve my performance.
    - My teamlead does not micromanage (i.e., get involved in details that should be handled at other levels).
    - My teamlead regularly shares relevant info and/or insights from the MT.
    - My teamlead is easy to approach with problems/concerns/feedback.
    - My teamlead communicates clear goals for our team.
    - My teamlead keeps the team focus on our priority results/deliverables/OKR?s.

- Optional: **Skip level session and upward feedback**
    
    **Skip level session:** 
    
    Also called an upward feedback session. A session where your team members sit down with your lead to talk about you. Your lead makes notes and shares them with you afterwords. 
    
    ?If you?re a manager of managers, you need to make sure that everyone on your team feels they can criticize their boss,? Scott says. But she?s quick to note that this does not mean encouraging your team to be boss killers. Instead, she recommends putting this advice into practice with a simple meeting ? commonly called a 'skip-level meeting,' though that sounds hierarchical, so she prefers to call them 'manager guidance sessions.'
    
    The process is straightforward: First, let your managers know that you?ll be scheduling a meeting with their direct reports. Get them comfortable with the idea, and make it clear that this meeting is intended to be helpful to them. Then explain the process to the reports, again making it clear that the goal of the meeting is to help their boss be a better manager ? and that the meeting is not for attribution.
Document 3:# Leading Feedback

We can not stress enough how we value feedback in all its forms.?**Good feedback is at the center of all people-related topics**. Good feedback is the key to a good collaboration, happy people and even a successful company. As a lead, you are responsible for leading the feedback for your people. This section will help you do so. Look at this list as a toolkit for you and your colleagues. 

[Our Feedback Process](Our%20Feedback%20Process%20c40fc80d546045ffb7076797301e81a8.md)

- **Make notes**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Well, because you forget. Plus making notes forces you to constantly think about the feedback. We would recommend making it a habit at the end of the week (weekly review ftw!): how did X do? 
    
    If you have a good system, it will also allow you to look back. ?Didn?t we discuss this already a year ago? It?s still an issue?. It also shows that you don?t forget and take this seriously.
    
    **How?**
    
    Docs, Evernote, Todoist, Wunderlist, Word, Things or even a notebook (I would not recommend a notebook). Whatever works. Just make small notes: You did well on project X and meeting Y, because ABC. I really liked when you did X, because it had an effect on ABC. It helps you during the reviews every 6 months.
    
- **Continuous Feedback**
    
    **Why?**
Document 4:- **Continuous Feedback**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Don?t save up feedback, it?s less powerful. Just speak your mind. The more often you do this, the easier it gets. This goes both ways: good and bad. I never heard someone say he or she got too much feedback.
    
    **How?** 
    
    Face to face is best (e-mail/slack/chat is ok for practical stuff).
    
    Praise in public, feedback 1on1.
    
    Think about:
    
    - quality of work: you did well on X. Because ABC.
    - way of working: you were slow and distracted, how can I help?
    - behaviour: try not to interrupt people during the meeting.
    
    There are a lot of tips out there on how to give feedback.
    
    I like the HIP-approach:
    
    - **H**umble
    - **H**elpful
    - **I**mmediate
    - **I**n person
    - **P**rivate criticism/ **P**ublic Praise
    - Not about **P**ersonality
    
    Source:
    
    [A HIP Approach to Feedback | Achieve Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/a-hip-approach-to-feedback/)
    
- **Have scheduled (bi-)weekly 1on1's**
    
    **Why?**
    
    It?s important and it's not going to happen if you don?t schedule it. If all is fine it might feel too much. It isn?t. Goal is to ?stay in touch? and simply have a relationship with someone. The relationship is the basis for being able to give good feedback and it makes it easier to receive too.

If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Don't try to make up an answer.

- **Have scheduled (bi-)weekly 1on1's**
    
    **Why?**
    
    It?s important and it's not going to happen if you don?t schedule it. If all is fine it might feel too much. It isn?t. Goal is to ?stay in touch? and simply have a relationship with someone. The relationship is the basis for being able to give good feedback and it makes it easier to receive too.

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","The purpose of upward feedback is to gather feedback from employees about their managers or leaders in order to improve their performance and address any issues or concerns. Upward feedback allows employees to provide their perspectives and insights on their manager's effectiveness in areas such as providing actionable feedback, avoiding micromanagement, sharing relevant information, being approachable, communicating clear goals, and keeping the team focused on priorities. It helps foster a culture of open communication and continuous improvement. Upward feedback can be collected through skip-level sessions or manager guidance sessions, where team members have a conversation with their manager's lead to provide feedback. It is important for managers to create a safe and non-attributable environment for these feedback sessions. Continuous feedback and regular 1-on-1 meetings are also recommended to maintain open lines of communication and build relationships between managers and employees.

    - **Week 1:** Make sure to **sit down with your lead** in the first few days to get to know each other and talk about expectations [and goals for the 1st month](http://goals.blendle.io/) and the 1st quarter (see below for a structure). Make sure to schedule your week 2 and week 4 check-ins.
    - **Week 2: Have a check-in** regarding expectations and goals. If there are doubts (from both sides): this is the time to say it. If there are severe doubts, think about scheduling another check-in next week (week 3).
    - **Week 4: Have a check-in** regarding expectations and goals. Your trial period ends and you wrap up your first month together. It's important to come up with a few personal goals in this talk. Think about feedback you got and things you would like to achieve, learn or do at Blendle. After this, you will receive continuous feedback and will be involved in the feedback cycle like everyone. This is also a good moment to schedule your weekly or bi-weekly 1on1's with your lead.

Document 2:**You have the responsibility to find out what rhythm works for you best, to be at your best.** Simply because we believe not everybody works the same way. So do you have the rhythm which works best for you? We want everybody to be able to bring their child, cat or car to daycare. Not because we love cats in particular (yes we do), but we want nothing to get in your way of getting the most out of your day. The fact that we don?t care when and how many times you go to a doctor, psych or barber is not because we want to be the ?cool employer?, but because you need your health to add value that day. So if that means visiting the barber once a week on Monday morning: please do.
    
    So have you found your rhythm yet? Rolo hates traffic jams so you?ll see him coming and going at exotic times. Alex is scrolling through his Twitter feed till late at night so you won't see him before 11:00 at the office. Rick?s alarm clock is set at 6:00 and we know he doesn?t snooze, so he?s in at 8:00, leaving early to have dinner with his wife.
    
    It might help announcing changes in your rythm to your team. It makes it feel legit for you, and your team members can help you with it.
    
    When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

So how are you?

[]()

- I'm good!
    
    Great, take some time to realize why you are doing fine and take measures in order to prevent yourself from getting to stressed.
    
- I?m okay-ish, but something needs to change.
    - Start by telling your team lead that you feel like you have been on your toes for a while and you think you need time to recover. Also tell your team. Also tell HR.
    - Come up with a concrete 2 week plan (we can help you with that) to release some of the first pressure. This will mean a less busy sprint, shorter days, and maybe 2 weeks of 4 days to start with (or a holiday). The hours you gain, you can spend on things you enjoy and help you reload (Netflix, sports, cinema, go to the beach, visit friends, play with model trains). We learned that just doing nothing, doesn?t always help, so make sure to spend time on things you like.
    - During these two weeks you check in with your team lead how your stress level is. You can make it really concrete by giving your stress level a number (1-10).

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","To update your performance goals, you should follow the steps outlined in the Blendle Employee Handbook. In your first week, you should schedule a meeting with your lead to discuss expectations and goals for the first month and quarter. In week 2 and week 4, you should have check-ins regarding expectations and goals. Additionally, you can use Blendle's tool for setting personal goals. For more information and specific instructions, refer to the Employee Handbook.

How can team leads support employees who want to grow in a different direction?,"Document 1:- Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

If you want to work at Blendle you can check our [job ads here](https://blendle.homerun.co/). If you want to be kept in the loop about Blendle, you can sign up for [our behind the scenes newsletter](https://blendle.homerun.co/yes-keep-me-posted/tr/apply?token=8092d4128c306003d97dd3821bad06f2)
Document 2:- Someone's **role is no longer a match**. Roles, jobs and their demands change. They aren't static. Pay attention to changing roles and put effort into telling your people what changed instead of implicitly expecting people to understand what changed. A changing role can be a reason for someone to no longer be the perfect match. Tell someone what we expect from them, make it clear. Work together to match those new demands but be honest if it doesn't work.
        
        This also works the other way around: some roles don't change, but people do. 
        
    - Someone wants to **grow in a different direction**. Blendle is still a small company so we can't just offer every possible career path. Use 1 on 1's to talk about someone's ambition and career path. Be honest and realistic about the possibilities at Blendle. Think about whether you think someone would be a good fit for that role and tell them what would be needed to get to that point (in terms of skills, expertise, personality, experience). The next question is whether Blendle has a role like that vacant. Be realistic and open about this.
Document 3:Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :). 
    

## Here's what you can do:

1. Actively **think** about the possibility that someone's time at Blendle is up. At least every month for everyone in your team.
2. **Flag** this at HR/MT when that happens. 
3. **Ask** for help if needed already at this stage.
4. **Analyse** (maybe together) the problem and give feedback to the person in question: try to get on the same page about where things go 'wrong'. These are pointers which might steer your thoughts. Real situations are always more complex. 
    - Someone is **underperforming**. Try using [the Matrix?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=0) to track down the areas where you think things should improve. Give actionable feedback and try to come up with concrete points to work on in his/her personal goals. Don't wait for the feedback cycle, the time is always now.
    - Someone **stopped growing or learning**. This isn't necessarily an immediate problem, but it can be because most people like working at Blendle because they grow and learn so much. Someone standing still for a year is a red flag.
Document 4:?In other words, I would tell the manager what everybody said but not who said it. Not because I wanted to foster secrecy, but because I wanted to help get the information out there,? says Scott. ?If there were too many things the team didn?t feel comfortable saying directly to their boss, and if it wasn?t getting better over time, that became the top thing I worked with the manager to change.?

    Just let us know if you would like one and we will organize it for you :).
    
    **Upward feedback**
    
    Something you can do yourself is asking for upward feedback using a typeform/googleform. Send these questions to your team and see where you're at:
    
    - My teamlead regularly gives me actionable feedback that helps me improve my performance.
    - My teamlead does not micromanage (i.e., get involved in details that should be handled at other levels).
    - My teamlead regularly shares relevant info and/or insights from the MT.
    - My teamlead is easy to approach with problems/concerns/feedback.
    - My teamlead communicates clear goals for our team.
    - My teamlead keeps the team focus on our priority results/deliverables/OKR?s.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

What is the suggestion regarding waiting for review cycles to address performance issues?,"Document 1:Don't wait for a review cycle or contract which expires to give this a thought.
    
- Optional: **Skip level session and upward feedback**
    
    **Skip level session:** 
    
    Also called an upward feedback session. A session where your team members sit down with your lead to talk about you. Your lead makes notes and shares them with you afterwords. 
    
    ?If you?re a manager of managers, you need to make sure that everyone on your team feels they can criticize their boss,? Scott says. But she?s quick to note that this does not mean encouraging your team to be boss killers. Instead, she recommends putting this advice into practice with a simple meeting ? commonly called a 'skip-level meeting,' though that sounds hierarchical, so she prefers to call them 'manager guidance sessions.'
    
    The process is straightforward: First, let your managers know that you?ll be scheduling a meeting with their direct reports. Get them comfortable with the idea, and make it clear that this meeting is intended to be helpful to them. Then explain the process to the reports, again making it clear that the goal of the meeting is to help their boss be a better manager ? and that the meeting is not for attribution.
Document 2:Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :).

1. Actively **think** about the possibility that someone's time at Blendle is up. At least every month for everyone in your team.
2. **Flag** this at HR/MT when that happens. 
3. **Ask** for help if needed already at this stage.
4. **Analyse** (maybe together) the problem and give feedback to the person in question: try to get on the same page about where things go 'wrong'. These are pointers which might steer your thoughts. Real situations are always more complex.

Give actionable feedback and try to come up with concrete points to work on in his/her personal goals. Don't wait for the feedback cycle, the time is always now.
    - Someone **stopped growing or learning**. This isn't necessarily an immediate problem, but it can be because most people like working at Blendle because they grow and learn so much. Someone standing still for a year is a red flag.
Document 3:We know this adds to your tally. Again, just becoming aware of this already helps.

And also again, when you see something causing a lot of stress, let?s get to work on it. Not digging the new team structure? Not feeling your current role? Not happy with your team lead?

We even got feedback on upgrading our Feedback process - all of which is incorporated into the new process below.

# **Typical Feedback Moments @ Blendle:**

- **Sprint retro** - every 2 weeks.  How did the cycle go?  What did we learn? How did we feel?

# The **Quarterly Coaching Feedback Process**

At least every Quarter we want to make sure you get a formal feedback and coaching conversation focused on your personal and professional development, and progress.  And luckily, the quarterly process aligns to the timing of our Objectives Goals Strategies Measures, so you can chat about both with your manager at the same time.

### The Process:

**YOU** run ***your*** process - End to End.  By having full ownership you control your development (that ****responsible** value again ?) and focus on **teamwork** **and ****honesty ****by discussing feedback together (rather than through your manager).  So you're developing from the development process itself!","Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer with references (""SOURCES""). 
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Don't try to make up an answer.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

What is the salary range for my position?,"Document 1:# Salary Review

- **How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?**
    
    We weigh up several variables:
    
    - **Benchmark:** internal and external.
        
        The most accurate way to determine the range where someone should be is comparing someone with a peer internally. During the hiring process you find out at what level someone is and you'll be able to compare him or her internally. Who would you compare this person to in terms of level? Is he/she better than X? If you notice that everyone is not as good as the people we have, but are paid more: think about raising the salary of our people. Keep in mind that - especially in tech - the market is on tilt. Big corporate pay a lot of money to even mediocare people in tech. We don't want to compete with them and that is a choice for new hires to make. 
        
    - **Classic figures:** experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise.
        
        This is a bit old school in a way, but also at Blendle there is a difference between someone who is a starter with no experience or someone with 8 years of experience. For some jobs/roles we need certain skills, expertise or even education. This always comes with a price tag. 
        
    - **Scarcity & market value.**
Document 2:- **Scarcity & market value.**
        
        It's fair to say that it's harder to fill some positions compared to some other roles. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.
        
    - **Role and responsibilities.**
        
        Certain roles and people make more impact than others. This is reflected in pay.
        
    - **Actual impact and contribution**
        
        Since we don't really like job titles, it's good to look at someone's actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? Can we try to put that in numbers or concrete projects?
        
    - **Someone's starting point**
        
        If we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.
        
    
    *Note: all of this is not an exact science and is determined together, so please: ask for help.*
    
- **When do we talk about money?**
    - **Yearly company wide salary raises in January**
        
        Every year (in January) we take a good look at all the salaries at Cafeyn- Blendle. Right after the feedback cycle (which we use as input) we have salary talks with everyone. We chose to do this once a year so we don't have a constant conversation about money through the year.
        
- **Off cycle salary increases**
Document 3:- 6**. Offer and closing**
    
    **Who is responsible**: hiring manager/teamlead and HR
    
    **Who is involved**: hiring manager/teamlead and HR
    
    **Timing follow-up:** asap
    
    **Goal:** make a fair offer and close
    
    **Note:** hiring manager = teamlead and is by default in the lead in this process. If you feel like it's better if HR or someone else does the offer: do so.
    
    **How:**
    
    1. **Determine offer:** hiring manager and HR determine salary offer together. 
    
    We weigh in several variables:
    
    - **Benchmark:** internal and external.
        
        The most accurate way to determine the range where someone should be is comparing someone with a peer internally. During the hiring process you find out at what level someone is and you'll be able to compare him or her internally. Who would you compare this person too in terms of level? Is he/she better than X? If you notice that everyone is not as good as the people we have, but are paid more: think about raising the salary of our people. Keep in mind that - especially in tech - the market is on tilt. Big corporate pay a lot of money to even mediocre people in tech. We don't want to compete with them and that is a choice for new hires to make. 
        
    - **Classic figures:** age, experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise.
Document 4:- **Off cycle salary increases**
    
    **Contract renewal** is not a moment that automatically means it is time to talk about money. We are not a company of people who demand *""give me X or I walk''*.  
    
    People can bring up salary any moment they want and we take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high) - see ""**How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?""**
    
    **Good reasons to raise offcycle**
    
    - Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.
    - Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone's impact and capabilities. It's important to be able to quantify that curve.
    - New information internally or externally.
    - New information by benchmarking studies or during hiring.
    
    **Not so good reasons to give a raise**
    
    - Colleague got another offer and uses this to get a raise.
    - 'I earn X for this company, that's a lot of money, I want a piece of the pie'.
    - Colleague just wants an incentive to stay. Money is never the answer, because it will fade - very - fast.
- **Control questions**
    
    Now before you finally decide
    
    - If we had to hire someone today for X's job, what would we pay them?
    - What would it cost Blendle as a business to find a new person (hard to replace, scarcity, time to hire, impact on day to day business & product)?","Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer with references (""SOURCES"").

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: What is the salary range for my position?
=========
Content: # Salary Review

- **How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?**
    
    We weigh up several variables:
    
    - **Benchmark:** internal and external.
        
        The most accurate way to determine the range where someone should be is comparing someone with a peer internally. During the hiring process you find out at what level someone is and you'll be able to compare him or her internally. Who would you compare this person to in terms of level? Is he/she better than X? If you notice that everyone is not as good as the people we have, but are paid more: think about raising the salary of our people. Keep in mind that - especially in tech - the market is on tilt. Big corporate pay a lot of money to even mediocare people in tech. We don't want to compete with them and that is a choice for new hires to make. 
        
    - **Classic figures:** experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise.
        
        This is a bit old school in a way, but also at Blendle there is a difference between someone who is a starter with no experience or someone with 8 years of experience. For some jobs/roles we need certain skills, expertise or even education. This always comes with a price tag. 
        
    - **Scarcity & market value.**

Content: - **Scarcity & market value.**
        
        It's fair to say that it's harder to fill some positions compared to some other roles. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.
        
    - **Role and responsibilities.**
        
        Certain roles and people make more impact than others. This is reflected in pay.
        
    - **Actual impact and contribution**
        
        Since we don't really like job titles, it's good to look at someone's actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? Can we try to put that in numbers or concrete projects?
        
    - **Someone's starting point**
        
        If we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.
        
    
    *Note: all of this is not an exact science and is determined together, so please: ask for help.*
    
- **When do we talk about money?**
    - **Yearly company wide salary raises in January**
        
        Every year (in January) we take a good look at all the salaries at Cafeyn- Blendle. Right after the feedback cycle (which we use as input) we have salary talks with everyone. We chose to do this once a year so we don't have a constant conversation about money through the year.

FINAL ANSWER:","The salary range for your position is determined based on several variables, including benchmarking, experience, education, market value, role and responsibilities, and actual impact and contribution. It is not an exact science and is determined together by the hiring manager and HR. Salary reviews are conducted annually in January, and off-cycle salary increases can be considered for reasons such as drastic changes in role and responsibilities or a steep learning curve. It is important to have control questions in place to assess the cost of finding a new person for the job.

Document 2:- Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level.

    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.

6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on.

Document 3:# Firing

Saying goodbye to Blendle (from a colleague) and to a colleague (from Blendle) is a very normal and natural thing. When done right, it can even be a beautiful thing.

    Saying goodbye to Blendle (from a colleague) and to a colleague (from Blendle) is a very normal and natural thing. When done right, it can even be a beautiful thing.
    
    Saying goodbye to people is also an important part of keeping your team on the right track. Firing can even be a part of your [Personnel Planning](Hiring%20fd6a5e1f88dd4476988147a3a62e1f0d.md). The most common situation will be when you think someone is no longer a good match with Blendle for whatever reason. This doesn't happen overnight, so try to spot situations where this is happening. 
    
    To make things clear: HR and Rick and Alex will help you with this, but we want this to be on your agenda. HR will take care of the process and paper- and legal work. Rick and Alex will help with the tough conversations. **The most important work happens months before that and that's where you come in.**
    
    Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :).
Document 4:2. **Life events:** 
        
        Life happens. Your cat dies, your car broke, you move to another city, you get married or have kids. Life events which all need your attention. We decided that we are not going to decide for you how much time you **get** for certain events. The question is: how much time do you actually **need.** 
        
        Most companies don't give you time off for funerals that are not for immediate relatives. We think we don't need a rule to tell us if that funeral is important for you. So take the time you need.
        
    
- Edge cases
    - Sabbatical: check with HR if you for example have plans to take a very long trip (longer then ~4 weeks).

    Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :).

        Life happens. Your cat dies, your car broke, you move to another city, you get married or have kids. Life events which all need your attention. We decided that we are not going to decide for you how much time you **get** for certain events. The question is: how much time do you actually **need.** 
        
        Most companies don't give you time off for funerals that are not for immediate relatives. We think we don't need a rule to tell us if that funeral is important for you. So take the time you need.

What are the core values of the company?,"Document 1:# Culture & Role-Modelling

This might be a given but we think it is so important that we dedicated a section to it: the soft shit. Everything that is not concrete or directly work-related, but is as important.  

- **Vision, mission and strategy**
    
    For people at Blendle, it's really important to know why they are doing what they do and what the effect or impact is. You probably constantly think and talk about why and how we do things. Don't forget that your team members often don't have that context. Here are two things to close that gap of information and context.
    
    - **Proactively share what was discussed in high-level meetings.** Also what did we decide not to do and how was the decision made (based on hypotheses or data?).
    - **Ask your team** if they know **why they are doing** what they're doing. Remind them of it if you feel the need.
- **Vibe and morale**
    
    Working in a nice and vibrant environment is important to all of us. A place where people are motivated, willing and positive. Do not underestimate the importance of this and the impact it can have on the daily work. Two things you can do:
    
    - Make it a recurring agenda point during retrospectives: how was the vibe during this sprint?
    - Address it if you feel morale is fading. It can be a red flag. Is it one person? One situation? One team? One project? Or is it more?
    
- **Culture**
Document 2:# Blendle value's

Putting our set of values or our way of life in writing wasn't an easy task. Mainly because the moment we started putting this in writing, it already altered. We started with a set of Blendle peeps writing down every word that came to mind when thinking about Blendle. We made categories and tried making sentences out of it. We shared that with the whole group, got some good feedback and slimmed it down to 5 powerful value's.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Document 2:# People System - Salarisbalie - Requesting Time off & Expensing

Salarisbalie is our payroll specialist and makes sure we get paid correctly every month, Salarisbalie works within a tool called NMBRS. NMBRS is used for saving and monitoring all personnel files,  personal information, holidays, dossiers, contracts, etc. 

When you start at Blendle, you get onboarded in this system. Easy peasy, everything in one place. 

You, HR and your lead have access to this self service tool.

So what can you do with Nmbrs?   Next to accessing your personal information and contracts, you can also change your contact information yourself. Plus, requesting time off and claiming expenses just became a whole lot easier: 

- **Time off request**
    
    **Why are we doing this if we have unlimited holidays?**
    The ""unlimited fair use"" rule stays. We are adding the balance for legal reasons. 
    
    And while we don't have a maximum, we do have a **minimum** that we want you to take, to keep you healthy - 20 days each year, for a 40 hour contract. 
    
    Plus, NMBRS has a super easy way to overview who is out of office and when, Blendle wide.  A great tool for teams and managers to plan work and availability especially around big projects or releases.
    
    **It looks weird in the system.....I see a negative balance!**
Document 3:# Travel costs and reimbursements

**CAR AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT TO THE OFFICE**

Document 4:**It looks weird in the system.....I see a negative balance!**
    
    For everyone with a 40 hours contract, the **minimum balance is set as 20 days** in NMBRS each year, and this re-sets at the start of each year.  In the case that you didn't take all 20 days by end of December (we hope this is not the case as you should take the advised minimum, at a minimum), these days will show in your balance for the next year for 6 months.
    
    (note: as we are introducing the tool in June 2020, the remaining balance is 10 for 2020, that's half of the normal balance)
    
    On the other hand, if **you exceed this minimum balance** you will show as negative in the system.  Nothing to worry about **-** remember... **we don't track your holidays in that kind of way**.  As long as your manager has agreed to your holidays and you have added your request, it's fine to go negative. 
    
    **How do I submit my holiday plans?**
    After discussing your time off with your lead and team, go to NMBRS to submit the request. To do so, log in to your [https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/](https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/) account and choose ""Verlof"". Fill in the dates, reason, save it and done!. Your lead will get a signal to approve the request through NMBRS.","Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer with references (""SOURCES"").

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror.

Salarisbalie is our payroll specialist and makes sure we get paid correctly every month, Salarisbalie works within a tool called NMBRS. NMBRS is used for saving and monitoring all personnel files,  personal information, holidays, dossiers, contracts, etc. 

When you start at Blendle, you get onboarded in this system. Easy peasy, everything in one place. 

You, HR and your lead have access to this self service tool.

So what can you do with Nmbrs?   Next to accessing your personal information and contracts, you can also change your contact information yourself. Plus, requesting time off and claiming expenses just became a whole lot easier: 

- **Time off request**
    
    **Why are we doing this if we have unlimited holidays?**
    The ""unlimited fair use"" rule stays. We are adding the balance for legal reasons. 
    
    And while we don't have a maximum, we do have a **minimum** that we want you to take, to keep you healthy - 20 days each year, for a 40 hour contract. 
    
    Plus, NMBRS has a super easy way to overview who is out of office and when, Blendle wide.  A great tool for teams and managers to plan work and availability especially around big projects or releases.

    For everyone with a 40 hours contract, the **minimum balance is set as 20 days** in NMBRS each year, and this re-sets at the start of each year.  In the case that you didn't take all 20 days by end of December (we hope this is not the case as you should take the advised minimum, at a minimum), these days will show in your balance for the next year for 6 months.
    
    (note: as we are introducing the tool in June 2020, the remaining balance is 10 for 2020, that's half of the normal balance)
    
    On the other hand, if **you exceed this minimum balance** you will show as negative in the system.  Nothing to worry about **-** remember... **we don't track your holidays in that kind of way**.  As long as your manager has agreed to your holidays and you have added your request, it's fine to go negative. 
    
    **How do I submit my holiday plans?**
    After discussing your time off with your lead and team, go to NMBRS to submit the request.

Can you explain the disciplinary actions and warnings policy?,"Document 1:# General disciplinary measures

Our Social code is crystal clear and very easily to follow. However, we also want to be clear about the consequences if for any reason you fail to follow the rules:

- **Verbal warning.** When we find it necessary to formally give you a warning. It might be a minor violation or your first time.
- **Official written warning**.  You will receive an official written warning for any serious breach of Blendle?s social code. This also applies when you already have had a maximum of two verbal warnings and your behavior hasn't improved. After 1 official written warning, we will move on to more serious measures like suspension or termination.
- **Suspension.** This happens when you have committed a very serious offense, or when we need time to investigate a case. Your access to Blendle will be temporarily revoked until it's clear whether and which measures should be taken.
- **Termination.** When the violation is of a very serious nature. These violations are most of the time determined by law and because of the severity of the act, we can terminate your contract immediately. Or, after an official written warning.

## When do we apply these measures

When we apply a measure, which measure we apply, and how long we apply it always depends on the situation and severity of the violation.

- Any form of harassment including bullying, intimidation, malicious gossip and victimisation of your colleagues, either inside or outside of the office.

Document 3:Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behavior is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn?t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions.

If you suspect that someone doesn?t realize their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when:

- Your lead, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.

- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.","Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer with references (""SOURCES"").

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Content: # Blendle Social Code

**We want you to feel safe, happy, free and able to express yourself authentically at Blendle. We won?t tolerate any form of bad behaviour, racism or (sexual) harassment. If any of this is happening (or you have the slightest feeling of discomfort), please speak up. We?ll support you. If you don?t feel comfortable talking to any of us, you can talk to our [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) (not a public link) at any time.**

This part of our handbook describes our social code in more detail. This social code describes what is acceptable and unacceptable behaviour when working at Blendle and the steps we will take to restore the values when someone violates them.

We were inspired after reading [this example from Workable](https://resources.workable.com/employee-code-of-conduct-company-policy) and used that as a starting point for this document.

**Why do we need this social code?**

By setting out our code our goal is to make sure it is crystal clear what is OK and what?s not. It is a starting point for healthy discussions, and we hope to support any feeling of mistreatment with it.

Document 4:# Addressing harassment

You are *always* in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward when you report an incident. We encourage you to talk about what happened.

If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8). In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it?s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. 

Here are the steps you can take, either:

- **Talk to the offender**. If you suspect that an offender doesn?t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.","Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer with references (""SOURCES""). 
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Don't try to make up an answer.

Content: # Addressing harassment

You are *always* in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward when you report an incident. We encourage you to talk about what happened.

If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8). In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it?s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. 

Here are the steps you can take, either:

- **Talk to the offender**. If you suspect that an offender doesn?t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.

FINAL ANSWER:","If the situation is not progressing despite efforts to fix it, the next step is to finish it up on time. This means that if the problem cannot be resolved and the situation is not improving, it may be necessary to part ways with the individual. In such cases, it is recommended to signal HR and relevant parties that both parties have tried everything but it is best to move on. They will provide assistance throughout the process.",Good

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

There is money and time you can spend on celebrating stuff and for learning and development.

You are in the lead for these two topics for your team. 

## Party budget

Apart from the Blendle-wide parties, outings and celebrations, we came up with a number for you to spend on team related stuff. **Every person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on fun stuff.** Why not ?80 or ?20? No good reason, we figured you could go out for dinner twice with your team for ?60. Every person keeps track of this for themselves.

Content: # Party and study budget

There is money and time you can spend on celebrating stuff and for learning and development. We want you, as a Team Lead, to feel free to spend this money and time within these boundaries so you don't need permission every time you spend it on these two topics. We want to create clarity so you have the liberty?to spend money on this. We don't want to limit your thinking by coming up with a budget, so feel free to ask HR if you'd like to bend the budgets for a good reason.

You are in the lead for these two topics for your team. 

## Party budget

Apart from the Blendle-wide parties, outings and celebrations, we came up with a number for you to spend on team related stuff. **Every person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on fun stuff.** Why not ?80 or ?20? No good reason, we figured you could go out for dinner twice with your team for ?60. Every person keeps track of this for themselves.  

## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in.""

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how.

Content: # Learning Budget

There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely.  Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? 

Does Blendle benefit from the fact that you are spending time and money on learning and development? 

Does this fit in your personal development path at Blendle? 

Does it match personal goals? 

Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

Would you spend the money on this if it was your own?

**Talk to your Lead, and they will help decide with finance for learning budget requests.**

Content: # Party and study budget

There is money and time you can spend on celebrating stuff and for learning and development. We want you, as a Team Lead, to feel free to spend this money and time within these boundaries so you don't need permission every time you spend it on these two topics. We want to create clarity so you have the liberty?to spend money on this. We don't want to limit your thinking by coming up with a budget, so feel free to ask HR if you'd like to bend the budgets for a good reason.

You are in the lead for these two topics for your team. 

## Party budget

Apart from the Blendle-wide parties, outings and celebrations, we came up with a number for you to spend on team related stuff. **Every person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on fun stuff.** Why not ?80 or ?20? No good reason, we figured you could go out for dinner twice with your team for ?60. Every person keeps track of this for themselves.  

## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in.""

Content: - **Blendle Premium:** 
we?ll hook you up with a Blendle Premium subscription.
- **Budget for study/courses/books/learning** etc.: 
there is money in our bank account and it?s up to us to spend it wisely. So yes, there is a budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable for Blendle to pitch in.
- **Blendle outings:** 
the party agenda is pretty full. You?ll be invited when there is a party ahead.
- **Flexible Holidays:** 
we think 4-6 weeks off per year is kinda the sweet spot, with at least once 2 weeks in a row. So that?s what we put in your contract.
- **Flexible hours**: 
we want you to find out what works for you best. Just know that we don't keep track of hours. We trust you.
- **Laptop**: 
we provide you with a laptop that suits your job. Ask HR for further info.
- **Workplace**: 
we've built a pretty nice office to make sure you like being at Blendle HQ. Feel free to sit where you want. Even better: dare to switch your workplace every once in a while.

How often are performance reviews conducted?,"Document 1:# Our Feedback Process

> At Blendle we value the **Freedom** and **Responsibility** of giving **Proactive** and **Honest** feedback to drive excellent **Team Work**.   We try to build input points into everything we do.  We even got feedback on upgrading our Feedback process - all of which is incorporated into the new process below.
> 

# **Typical Feedback Moments @ Blendle:**

- **Sprint retro** - every 2 weeks.  How did the cycle go?  What did we learn? How did we feel?
- **Agile Process retro** - Monthly.  How can we improve the process and collaboration?
- **BIG HR People Surve**y - two times a year Q1 and Q4 on Employee experience.
- **EVERYDAY!**

# The **Quarterly Coaching Feedback Process**

At least every Quarter we want to make sure you get a formal feedback and coaching conversation focused on your personal and professional development, and progress.  And luckily, the quarterly process aligns to the timing of our Objectives Goals Strategies Measures, so you can chat about both with your manager at the same time.

### The Process:

**YOU** run ***your*** process - End to End.  By having full ownership you control your development (that ****responsible** value again ?) and focus on **teamwork** **and ****honesty ****by discussing feedback together (rather than through your manager).  So you're developing from the development process itself!
Document 2:**Who is involved**: hiring team and HR
    
    **Timing follow-up:** asap
    
    **Goal:** all-round assessment and selling
    
    **How:**
    
    Format pair day (example):
    
    Most important part is that the whole hiring team gets together to make a hiring decision. Could be the end of the day, could be the next day. Everybody should have a rating 1-3 on Work Drive and Fit + reasoning. 
    
    The meeting format: *on the count of three* show 1, 2 or 3 fingers for Work (your rating). Discuss the ratings. Do the same for Drive and Fit. 
    
    End with an *on the count of three:* show thumbs up or thumbs down on hiring. Hiring decisions should be conclusive. 
    
- **5. Reference check**
    
    **Who is responsible**: hiring manager/teamlead
    
    **Who is involved**: hiring manager/teamlead
    
    **Timing follow-up:** asap
    
    **Goal:** As hiring manager you want to ensure we are hiring the right candidate. And to understand under what circumstances a candidate thrives or doesn't.
    
    **How:**
    
    The hiring manager or the hiring team will contact references before proceeding. Ask for references at the end of the pair day. You should check them before making an offer. Try at least 2 references. Write a short report of the conversation in github or homerun.
    
    **Questions you can as a reference are for example:**
    
    - Can you describe your working relationship with this person?
Document 3:- **Continuous Feedback**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Don?t save up feedback, it?s less powerful. Just speak your mind. The more often you do this, the easier it gets. This goes both ways: good and bad. I never heard someone say he or she got too much feedback.
    
    **How?** 
    
    Face to face is best (e-mail/slack/chat is ok for practical stuff).
    
    Praise in public, feedback 1on1.
    
    Think about:
    
    - quality of work: you did well on X. Because ABC.
    - way of working: you were slow and distracted, how can I help?
    - behaviour: try not to interrupt people during the meeting.
    
    There are a lot of tips out there on how to give feedback.
    
    I like the HIP-approach:
    
    - **H**umble
    - **H**elpful
    - **I**mmediate
    - **I**n person
    - **P**rivate criticism/ **P**ublic Praise
    - Not about **P**ersonality
    
    Source:
    
    [A HIP Approach to Feedback | Achieve Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/a-hip-approach-to-feedback/)
    
- **Have scheduled (bi-)weekly 1on1's**
    
    **Why?**
    
    It?s important and it's not going to happen if you don?t schedule it. If all is fine it might feel too much. It isn?t. Goal is to ?stay in touch? and simply have a relationship with someone. The relationship is the basis for being able to give good feedback and it makes it easier to receive too.
    
    **How?**
Document 4:Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :). 
    

## Here's what you can do:

1. Actively **think** about the possibility that someone's time at Blendle is up. At least every month for everyone in your team.
2. **Flag** this at HR/MT when that happens. 
3. **Ask** for help if needed already at this stage.
4. **Analyse** (maybe together) the problem and give feedback to the person in question: try to get on the same page about where things go 'wrong'. These are pointers which might steer your thoughts. Real situations are always more complex. 
    - Someone is **underperforming**. Try using [the Matrix?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=0) to track down the areas where you think things should improve. Give actionable feedback and try to come up with concrete points to work on in his/her personal goals. Don't wait for the feedback cycle, the time is always now.
    - Someone **stopped growing or learning**. This isn't necessarily an immediate problem, but it can be because most people like working at Blendle because they grow and learn so much. Someone standing still for a year is a red flag.","Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer with references (""SOURCES"").

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

How do I update my personal information?,"Document 1:# YOUR first week x

# **First!**

Please update the personal information of your Blendle [Google account](https://myaccount.google.com/privacy) with your phone number. You can find the contact details of all your colleagues in [this directory](https://contacts.google.com/directory) (not public).

**TL;DR**

1. Set up your accounts
2. Get some basic intel
3. Introduce yourself

**Google (G Suite)**

We use Google G Suite for email, calendars, spreadsheets and documents. We will set you up with a personal Google account (`[username]@blendle.com`), which is your identity within Blendle. You can use this account to sign in to both internal (e.g. 'goals', 'get-a-room') and external apps and services (through single sign-on).

# **Part 1: setting up your accounts and tools**

You can log in at: [http](https://www.google.com/a/blendle.com)[s[://www.google.com/a/blendle.com](https://www.google.com/a/blendle.com)

Note that two-step verification is mandatory. You will be required to set this up at your first login. You can find more information at [the help page](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?hl=nl).

**Slack**
Document 2:People team uses this system to save and track all your personal documents and information as well. Whenever something changes, this will go through this system. You can change your contact information and address if you move. You can also always access this system to have a look at your documents, eg contract, reviews etc.

You can also send in your requests for reimbursement of business expenses and holidays.   

**Security**

We care about security. So, whenever possible (Google apps, GitHub etc): use two-factor authentication! And please turn on Full Disk Encryption (FileVault on Mac) on your computer. And of course, whether you're at the office or somewhere else,?be sure to lock your computer whenever you are AFK. And whenever you hear ?Brace, Brace!?, be sure to get yourself into brace-position. It is for your own and our safety. :-)

For sharing secure stuff with each other we use [Tresorit](https://tresorit.com/). Be sure to download that! If you need it, your team will also mention this, so don?t worry! Oh, and in case you?re wondering: we don?t share any user information via Slack or Google.

**1Password**

You should use a password manager to manage your secrets (e.g. passwords for your personal accounts or credit card details). This allows you to use *unique* passwords for your different accounts.

You can sign up for 1Password for Teams [here](https://www.notion.so/4bb2545b52664e7687a408c1e3262939) (not public).

**Recruitment**

This might be one of the most important questions: Who would you like to work with? You might have noticed: we?re expanding! While trying to conquer the world, we need to gather our own army of super-duper extraterrestrial-powered heroes (you know them as your colleagues). We still have a lot of vacancies open? but apart from them, we?re always looking for new recruits. So, do you know anyone fitting the (or a) profile? Let them know we?re looking for ?em or let HR know they need to contact them.

**Business intelligence**

Sounds cool. It is. We want everybody to be informed and make the best decisions possible because all the intel is available. This is also a great way to be transparant. You get all the tools you need and acces to all the data. [Go to this page (made by the BI peeps) and go nuts](https://www.notion.so/8f7739b14e754f7194992ce9b34d0d07) (not public).

# **Part 3: Let?s intro the shit out of this:**

**Introduce yourself!!1!**

You?ve made it to the end of this post. Respect. Last but not least is introducing yourself. How? Just send an email to [all@blendle.com](mailto:all@blendle.com) before your first day.
Document 4:1. Ask HR to duplicate a template for you and make you hiring manager or reuse an existing job description and go from there. 
    2. Go to edit:
        
        ![Hiring%20fd6a5e1f88dd4476988147a3a62e1f0d/Schermafbeelding2018-07-10om13.11.25.png](Hiring%20fd6a5e1f88dd4476988147a3a62e1f0d/Schermafbeelding2018-07-10om13.11.25.png)
        
    3. Adjust the job description to your liking:
        - The first section is about the team, what they do and the reason why we are hiring.
        - The second section consists of the 4-5 reasons we chose to work at Blendle. You can alter them, but you can keep those the same.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: How do I update my personal information?
=========
Content: # YOUR first week x

# **First!**

Please update the personal information of your Blendle [Google account](https://myaccount.google.com/privacy) with your phone number. You can find the contact details of all your colleagues in [this directory](https://contacts.google.com/directory) (not public).

**TL;DR**

1. Set up your accounts
2. Get some basic intel
3. Introduce yourself

**Google (G Suite)**

We use Google G Suite for email, calendars, spreadsheets and documents. We will set you up with a personal Google account (`[username]@blendle.com`), which is your identity within Blendle. You can use this account to sign in to both internal (e.g. 'goals', 'get-a-room') and external apps and services (through single sign-on).

# **Part 1: setting up your accounts and tools**

You can log in at: [http](https://www.google.com/a/blendle.com)[s[://www.google.com/a/blendle.com](https://www.google.com/a/blendle.com)

Note that two-step verification is mandatory. You will be required to set this up at your first login. You can find more information at [the help page](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?hl=nl).

Content: People team uses this system to save and track all your personal documents and information as well. Whenever something changes, this will go through this system. You can change your contact information and address if you move. You can also always access this system to have a look at your documents, eg contract, reviews etc.

You can also send in your requests for reimbursement of business expenses and holidays.   

**Security**

We care about security. So, whenever possible (Google apps, GitHub etc): use two-factor authentication! And please turn on Full Disk Encryption (FileVault on Mac) on your computer. And of course, whether you're at the office or somewhere else,?be sure to lock your computer whenever you are AFK. And whenever you hear ?Brace, Brace!?, be sure to get yourself into brace-position. It is for your own and our safety. :-)

For sharing secure stuff with each other we use [Tresorit](https://tresorit.com/). Be sure to download that! If you need it, your team will also mention this, so don?t worry! Oh, and in case you?re wondering: we don?t share any user information via Slack or Google.

**1Password**

You should use a password manager to manage your secrets (e.g. passwords for your personal accounts or credit card details). This allows you to use *unique* passwords for your different accounts.

You can sign up for 1Password for Teams [here](https://www.notion.so/4bb2545b52664e7687a408c1e3262939) (not public).

**Recruitment**

This might be one of the most important questions: Who would you like to work with? You might have noticed: we?re expanding! While trying to conquer the world, we need to gather our own army of super-duper extraterrestrial-powered heroes (you know them as your colleagues). We still have a lot of vacancies open? but apart from them, we?re always looking for new recruits. So, do you know anyone fitting the (or a) profile? Let them know we?re looking for ?em or let HR know they need to contact them.

**Business intelligence**

Sounds cool. It is. We want everybody to be informed and make the best decisions possible because all the intel is available. This is also a great way to be transparant. You get all the tools you need and acces to all the data. [Go to this page (made by the BI peeps) and go nuts](https://www.notion.so/8f7739b14e754f7194992ce9b34d0d07) (not public).

Content: 1. Ask HR to duplicate a template for you and make you hiring manager or reuse an existing job description and go from there. 
    2. Go to edit:
        
        ![Hiring%20fd6a5e1f88dd4476988147a3a62e1f0d/Schermafbeelding2018-07-10om13.11.25.png](Hiring%20fd6a5e1f88dd4476988147a3a62e1f0d/Schermafbeelding2018-07-10om13.11.25.png)
        
    3. Adjust the job description to your liking:
        - The first section is about the team, what they do and the reason why we are hiring.
        - The second section consists of the 4-5 reasons we chose to work at Blendle. You can alter them, but you can keep those the same.
        - The third section is our wishlist: alter these to get the most important stuff from your intake (above) across.
        - The last step is altering the Application form (click 'Application form' next to 'Job post').

            The section 'Questions' is most important for now. Make sure to come up with a few good job-related questions based on your intake.

Document 2:# Salary Review

- **How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?**
    
    We weigh up several variables:
    
    - **Benchmark:** internal and external.
        
        The most accurate way to determine the range where someone should be is comparing someone with a peer internally. During the hiring process you find out at what level someone is and you'll be able to compare him or her internally. Who would you compare this person to in terms of level? Is he/she better than X? If you notice that everyone is not as good as the people we have, but are paid more: think about raising the salary of our people. Keep in mind that - especially in tech - the market is on tilt. Big corporate pay a lot of money to even mediocare people in tech. We don't want to compete with them and that is a choice for new hires to make. 
        
    - **Classic figures:** experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise.
        
        This is a bit old school in a way, but also at Blendle there is a difference between someone who is a starter with no experience or someone with 8 years of experience. For some jobs/roles we need certain skills, expertise or even education. This always comes with a price tag. 
        
    - **Scarcity & market value.**

Document 4:## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how. Does this fit in someones personal development path at Blendle? Does it match the personal goals? Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

A good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own. The rest is common sense.

As leads you can decide to say Yes or No to budget requests based on the above questions. If you need help deciding, you can discuss with HR.

**?0-?250** = no study contract. Like a cool book, online course or a ticket to a summit.

**?250-1500 =** 12 months study contract. Like a full blown study/course or a conference (abroad).

**?1500+** = edge case with 24 months study contract, please discuss with HR.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

There is money and time you can spend on celebrating stuff and for learning and development. We want you, as a Team Lead, to feel free to spend this money and time within these boundaries so you don't need permission every time you spend it on these two topics. We want to create clarity so you have the liberty?to spend money on this. We don't want to limit your thinking by coming up with a budget, so feel free to ask HR if you'd like to bend the budgets for a good reason.

You are in the lead for these two topics for your team. 

## Party budget

Apart from the Blendle-wide parties, outings and celebrations, we came up with a number for you to spend on team related stuff. **Every person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on fun stuff.** Why not ?80 or ?20? No good reason, we figured you could go out for dinner twice with your team for ?60. Every person keeps track of this for themselves.  

## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in.""

- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately.

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Document 3:- **Telephone costs/reimbursements:** if you need to make a lot of phone calls for Blendle, we?ll reimburse your costs. Same goes for other costs.
        - **Pension:** we facilitate pensions via [Bright Pensioen](https://brightpensioen.nl/). Bright is not your standard pension plan. We think it?s better than the mandatory corporate pension scheme which you might be used to. [This video](https://youtu.be/xfZM2JuovJM?t=1941) explains a bit about pensions in general and it starts at the point where they explain what Bright Pensioen is and why we chose it. At the moment Blendle can?t afford a full blown pension plan, but we want to do what we can. That?s why Blendle pays the costs to Bright, so the money you put aside, goes straight to your pension. I also attached a presentation Bright did at Blendle.
        - **Option plan:** there is an Option plan. Options are worth a lot for us, because it is the most precious thing we have: a part of our company. So we don?t hand them out by default, we just want you to know it?s there and that we can explain the details to you later if you want.
        - **Laptop:** a good laptop is important, so you get one from us. Special needs? Let me know.
        - **Equipment:** we have electric sit-stand-desks and good chairs so your back stays in shape and there are more than enough screens and additional equipment at the office.
        - **Massages:** once a week, our masseuse gets rid of all our stress with her chair massages.
Document 4:**Example payout:**

- The yearly subscription costs are ?72,-.
- You purchase a subscription on 10-12-2019 which ends on 10-12-2020.

Content: - **Telephone costs/reimbursements:** if you need to make a lot of phone calls for Blendle, we?ll reimburse your costs. Same goes for other costs.
        - **Pension:** we facilitate pensions via [Bright Pensioen](https://brightpensioen.nl/). Bright is not your standard pension plan. We think it?s better than the mandatory corporate pension scheme which you might be used to. [This video](https://youtu.be/xfZM2JuovJM?t=1941) explains a bit about pensions in general and it starts at the point where they explain what Bright Pensioen is and why we chose it. At the moment Blendle can?t afford a full blown pension plan, but we want to do what we can. That?s why Blendle pays the costs to Bright, so the money you put aside, goes straight to your pension. I also attached a presentation Bright did at Blendle.
        - **Option plan:** there is an Option plan. Options are worth a lot for us, because it is the most precious thing we have: a part of our company. So we don?t hand them out by default, we just want you to know it?s there and that we can explain the details to you later if you want.
        - **Laptop:** a good laptop is important, so you get one from us. Special needs? Let me know.
        - **Equipment:** we have electric sit-stand-desks and good chairs so your back stays in shape and there are more than enough screens and additional equipment at the office.
        - **Massages:** once a week, our masseuse gets rid of all our stress with her chair massages.

Content: **Example payout:**

- The yearly subscription costs are ?72,-.
- You purchase a subscription on 10-12-2019 which ends on 10-12-2020.

Why is it important to explain why we do things differently in the context of culture?,"Document 1:# Culture & Role-Modelling

This might be a given but we think it is so important that we dedicated a section to it: the soft shit. Everything that is not concrete or directly work-related, but is as important.  

- **Vision, mission and strategy**
    
    For people at Blendle, it's really important to know why they are doing what they do and what the effect or impact is. You probably constantly think and talk about why and how we do things. Don't forget that your team members often don't have that context. Here are two things to close that gap of information and context.
    
    - **Proactively share what was discussed in high-level meetings.** Also what did we decide not to do and how was the decision made (based on hypotheses or data?).
    - **Ask your team** if they know **why they are doing** what they're doing. Remind them of it if you feel the need.
- **Vibe and morale**
    
    Working in a nice and vibrant environment is important to all of us. A place where people are motivated, willing and positive. Do not underestimate the importance of this and the impact it can have on the daily work. Two things you can do:
    
    - Make it a recurring agenda point during retrospectives: how was the vibe during this sprint?
    - Address it if you feel morale is fading. It can be a red flag. Is it one person? One situation? One team? One project? Or is it more?
    
- **Culture**
Document 2:**You have the responsibility to find out what rhythm works for you best, to be at your best.** Simply because we believe not everybody works the same way. So do you have the rhythm which works best for you? We want everybody to be able to bring their child, cat or car to daycare. Not because we love cats in particular (yes we do), but we want nothing to get in your way of getting the most out of your day. The fact that we don?t care when and how many times you go to a doctor, psych or barber is not because we want to be the ?cool employer?, but because you need your health to add value that day. So if that means visiting the barber once a week on Monday morning: please do.
    
    So have you found your rhythm yet? Rolo hates traffic jams so you?ll see him coming and going at exotic times. Alex is scrolling through his Twitter feed till late at night so you won't see him before 11:00 at the office. Rick?s alarm clock is set at 6:00 and we know he doesn?t snooze, so he?s in at 8:00, leaving early to have dinner with his wife.
    
    It might help announcing changes in your rythm to your team. It makes it feel legit for you, and your team members can help you with it.
    
    When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:
Document 3:- Address it if you feel morale is fading. It can be a red flag. Is it one person? One situation? One team? One project? Or is it more?
    
- **Culture**
    
    Lead by example when it comes to culture. We tried pinning down our DNA by writing down our operating principles but we came to the conclusion it's essentially all about you. The people themselves are the culture and we guard that culture. What you stand for, what you believe in and how we treat each other is part of our DNA. So be yourself and keep expressing yourself to your team. 'This is not how we do things' is a totally fine comment. Don't forget to explain why though :).

- **Relate and care personally**
    
    The people around you are probably one of the reasons you like working at Blendle. We are not robots, so relate to your team. As a lead, it's good to **invest in personal relationships**. This will help you in so many ways.

**What we do:**

- Fight bias in hiring. For example by not asking for a resume when people apply, but asking questions related to the actual job. This way the first judgement is based on relevant information, not on age or a picture.
- Emphasize the fact that we would like more diverse profiles to reply on our job postings by adding it to our vacancies. In Dutch: *""Niet onbelangrijk: we vinden diversiteit belangrijk, dus laat je alsjeblieft niet tegenhouden om te solliciteren als je anders denkt of er anders uitziet.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

FINAL ANSWER:","It is important to explain why we do things differently in the context of culture because it helps provide information and context to team members who may not have the same understanding. By sharing the reasons behind decisions and actions, it helps bridge the gap and ensures that everyone is on the same page. Additionally, explaining why we do things differently in the context of culture helps create a positive work environment and promotes morale and unity among team members. It also allows for open communication and understanding, which is essential for a diverse and inclusive workplace.

What are the working hours?,"Document 1:- You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.
    - This is a guideline.  If you have other national holidays you observe (eg Eid al-Fitr Suikerfeest, ending of Ramadan) feel free to work or be off when you want.
    
    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.
    - You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.
    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.
- **Backdrop**
    
    The law and additional ruling tell us what we can and can not do according to time off. We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:
Document 2:When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:
    
    - **It is impossible to work 60 hours productively over a longer period of time.** It hurts you and Blendle to work that much. If you are able to work 8 productive hours a day you should be proud of that. Sometimes it will be 6, sometimes 10: relax, it?s okay, You?re not working in a factory with time stamps.
    - Be flexible. Some days you just don?t have it. **You are not a machine.** Of course, first you?ll take a walk and grab a double espresso or a Club Mate, but if that doesn?t work it?s okay. Go home. Go to the gym. Go play with your kid. Go kiting. Go for a walk in the forest. Anything, just don?t sit behind your desk to ?make the hours?. That?s not helping anybody.
    - Working at home vs. at Blendle HQ. Try to strike a **balance between home/office**. Meetings and brainstorms are best done face to face but a day of deep work is best done in a cafe or on an abandoned island with 4g.
    - **Rotate, change your pace.** During the summer it can be nice to start at 6:30 and bike to the beach at 15.00h. During the winter, every morning might feel like a small hangover and you stroll into HQ at 10:00 after your first 2 cups of coffee.
- **Take care of your body and mind**
    
    
    **Take holidays and days off.**
Document 3:'Time off' can be divided into two buckets:
    
    1. **Holidays and national holidays**:
        
        Your contract states you have 4 weeks of paid time off per year, by law.
        
        On average we have 8 national holidays per year. We have no CAO (collective employment agreement), which means you are not entitled to paid time off on every national holiday. We decided to follow the most common situation in an average company, which in practice means most people are off on the big national holidays. But that's your own choice, it's not a right or an obligation, so feel free to improvise. Some teams even have to (editorial and support, for example).
        
        These rules state that we are off on 'Bevrijdingsdag' once every 5 years. But we aren't allowed time off on Eid al-Fitr (Suikerfeest, ending of the Ramadan). That makes no sense to us. 
        
        So here is how we approach holidays and national holidays in practice.
        
        You 'have' 5 weeks holiday and ~8 national holidays per year. We want you to use this time off to reload but you decide when and how to consume this. You must also feel free to improvise. You work hard, maybe even a bit too hard, so you might need some extra time off to stay happy and healthy. This also works the other way around: maybe you had a chill quarter and feel no need to take a holiday: feel free to do so. We want you to think about what your body and mind needs instead of your quota.
Document 4:- We work hard, we need time to reload and rest. Sometimes we work harder, so we need more. Some times we work less, so we need less.
    - We have something called 'life' happening which means we can't work because we have more important stuff to do.
    
    We want you to take enough rest to reload and recharge so you can be at your prime when working. Taking enough rest is as important as giving it your all when working. The well known on and off switch.
    
    The concept of work isn't always caught in time (40 hours) and place. Most of the people at Blendle don't keep track of time because time is such a limited variable to grasp the concept of work. There is a balance to strike here and just looking at hours or a holiday quota limits this discussion. 
    
    **That is why we don't keep track of holidays.**
    
    Our people don't have a holiday quota, but a moral obligation to their loved ones and Blendle to work hard and take enough time to rest. Alright, sounds heavy. How does that work?
    
    'Time off' can be divided into two buckets:
    
    1. **Holidays and national holidays**:
        
        Your contract states you have 4 weeks of paid time off per year, by law.","Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer with references (""SOURCES"").

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

FINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.

QUESTION: What are the working hours?
=========
Content: - You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.
    - This is a guideline.  If you have other national holidays you observe (eg Eid al-Fitr Suikerfeest, ending of Ramadan) feel free to work or be off when you want.
    
    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.
    - You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.
    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.
- **Backdrop**
    
    The law and additional ruling tell us what we can and can not do according to time off. We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:

Content: When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:
    
    - **It is impossible to work 60 hours productively over a longer period of time.** It hurts you and Blendle to work that much. If you are able to work 8 productive hours a day you should be proud of that. Sometimes it will be 6, sometimes 10: relax, it?s okay, You?re not working in a factory with time stamps.
    - Be flexible. Some days you just don?t have it. **You are not a machine.** Of course, first you?ll take a walk and grab a double espresso or a Club Mate, but if that doesn?t work it?s okay. Go home. Go to the gym. Go play with your kid. Go kiting. Go for a walk in the forest. Anything, just don?t sit behind your desk to ?make the hours?. That?s not helping anybody.
    - Working at home vs. at Blendle HQ. Try to strike a **balance between home/office**. Meetings and brainstorms are best done face to face but a day of deep work is best done in a cafe or on an abandoned island with 4g.
    - **Rotate, change your pace.** During the summer it can be nice to start at 6:30 and bike to the beach at 15.00h. During the winter, every morning might feel like a small hangover and you stroll into HQ at 10:00 after your first 2 cups of coffee.
- **Take care of your body and mind**
    
    
    **Take holidays and days off.**

Content: 'Time off' can be divided into two buckets:
    
    1. **Holidays and national holidays**:
        
        Your contract states you have 4 weeks of paid time off per year, by law.
        
        On average we have 8 national holidays per year. We have no CAO (collective employment agreement), which means you are not entitled to paid time off on every national holiday. We decided to follow the most common situation in an average company, which in practice means most people are off on the big national holidays. But that's your own choice, it's not a right or an obligation, so feel free to improvise. Some teams even have to (editorial and support, for example).
        
        These rules state that we are off on 'Bevrijdingsdag' once every 5 years. But we aren't allowed time off on Eid al-Fitr (Suikerfeest, ending of the Ramadan). That makes no sense to us. 
        
        So here is how we approach holidays and national holidays in practice.
        
        You 'have' 5 weeks holiday and ~8 national holidays per year. We want you to use this time off to reload but you decide when and how to consume this. You must also feel free to improvise. You work hard, maybe even a bit too hard, so you might need some extra time off to stay happy and healthy. This also works the other way around: maybe you had a chill quarter and feel no need to take a holiday: feel free to do so. We want you to think about what your body and mind needs instead of your quota.

Content: - We work hard, we need time to reload and rest. Sometimes we work harder, so we need more. Some times we work less, so we need less.
    - We have something called 'life' happening which means we can't work because we have more important stuff to do.
    
    We want you to take enough rest to reload and recharge so you can be at your prime when working. Taking enough rest is as important as giving it your all when working. The well known on and off switch.
    
    The concept of work isn't always caught in time (40 hours) and place. Most of the people at Blendle don't keep track of time because time is such a limited variable to grasp the concept of work. There is a balance to strike here and just looking at hours or a holiday quota limits this discussion. 
    
    **That is why we don't keep track of holidays.**
    
    Our people don't have a holiday quota, but a moral obligation to their loved ones and Blendle to work hard and take enough time to rest. Alright, sounds heavy. How does that work?
    
    'Time off' can be divided into two buckets:
    
    1. **Holidays and national holidays**:
        
        Your contract states you have 4 weeks of paid time off per year, by law.

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","There is no specific mention of working hours in the provided content. It states that employees should take enough moments of rest when they have periods of working hard and emphasizes the importance of balance and flexibility. It also mentions that the concept of work is not always limited to a specific number of hours and that time off can be divided into holidays and national holidays. However, it does not provide specific working hour guidelines.

What are some good reasons for raising someone's salary off-cycle?,"Document 1:- **Off cycle salary increases**
    
    **Contract renewal** is not a moment that automatically means it is time to talk about money. We are not a company of people who demand *""give me X or I walk''*.  
    
    People can bring up salary any moment they want and we take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high) - see ""**How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?""**
    
    **Good reasons to raise offcycle**
    
    - Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.
    - Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone's impact and capabilities. It's important to be able to quantify that curve.
    - New information internally or externally.
    - New information by benchmarking studies or during hiring.
    
    **Not so good reasons to give a raise**
    
    - Colleague got another offer and uses this to get a raise.
    - 'I earn X for this company, that's a lot of money, I want a piece of the pie'.
    - Colleague just wants an incentive to stay. Money is never the answer, because it will fade - very - fast.
- **Control questions**
    
    Now before you finally decide
    
    - If we had to hire someone today for X's job, what would we pay them?
    - What would it cost Blendle as a business to find a new person (hard to replace, scarcity, time to hire, impact on day to day business & product)?
Document 2:- **Scarcity & market value.**
        
        It's fair to say that it's harder to fill some positions compared to some other roles. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.
        
    - **Role and responsibilities.**
        
        Certain roles and people make more impact than others. This is reflected in pay.
        
    - **Actual impact and contribution**
        
        Since we don't really like job titles, it's good to look at someone's actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? Can we try to put that in numbers or concrete projects?
        
    - **Someone's starting point**
        
        If we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.
        
    
    *Note: all of this is not an exact science and is determined together, so please: ask for help.*
    
- **When do we talk about money?**
    - **Yearly company wide salary raises in January**
        
        Every year (in January) we take a good look at all the salaries at Cafeyn- Blendle. Right after the feedback cycle (which we use as input) we have salary talks with everyone. We chose to do this once a year so we don't have a constant conversation about money through the year.
        
- **Off cycle salary increases**
Document 3:- What would it cost Blendle as a business to find a new person (hard to replace, scarcity, time to hire, impact on day to day business & product)?
    - Giving a raise to an individual changes the salary house, so keep that in mind when you decide on a raise. Does this apply to more people?

FINAL ANSWER:","Some good reasons for raising someone's salary off-cycle include a drastic change in role and responsibilities, a steep learning curve that makes current pay unfair, new information internally or externally, and new information from benchmarking studies or during hiring. However, it is not a good reason to give a raise if a colleague got another offer and uses it to negotiate, or if a colleague simply wants an incentive to stay. It is important to consider factors such as scarcity and market value, role and responsibilities, actual impact and contribution, and someone's starting point when determining salary. Salary talks typically occur yearly in January, but off-cycle salary increases can be discussed if necessary. It is also important to consider the cost to the company of finding a new person and the impact on the salary house when deciding on a raise.

Document 2:# Blendle Social Code

**We want you to feel safe, happy, free and able to express yourself authentically at Blendle. We won?t tolerate any form of bad behaviour, racism or (sexual) harassment. If any of this is happening (or you have the slightest feeling of discomfort), please speak up. We?ll support you. If you don?t feel comfortable talking to any of us, you can talk to our [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) (not a public link) at any time.**

This part of our handbook describes our social code in more detail. This social code describes what is acceptable and unacceptable behaviour when working at Blendle and the steps we will take to restore the values when someone violates them.

We were inspired after reading [this example from Workable](https://resources.workable.com/employee-code-of-conduct-company-policy) and used that as a starting point for this document.

**Why do we need this social code?**

By setting out our code our goal is to make sure it is crystal clear what is OK and what?s not. It is a starting point for healthy discussions, and we hope to support any feeling of mistreatment with it.

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?lle is in charge of lunch ??ask her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Document 2:# People System - Salarisbalie - Requesting Time off & Expensing

Salarisbalie is our payroll specialist and makes sure we get paid correctly every month, Salarisbalie works within a tool called NMBRS. NMBRS is used for saving and monitoring all personnel files,  personal information, holidays, dossiers, contracts, etc. 

When you start at Blendle, you get onboarded in this system. Easy peasy, everything in one place. 

You, HR and your lead have access to this self service tool.

So what can you do with Nmbrs?   Next to accessing your personal information and contracts, you can also change your contact information yourself. Plus, requesting time off and claiming expenses just became a whole lot easier: 

- **Time off request**
    
    **Why are we doing this if we have unlimited holidays?**
    The ""unlimited fair use"" rule stays. We are adding the balance for legal reasons. 
    
    And while we don't have a maximum, we do have a **minimum** that we want you to take, to keep you healthy - 20 days each year, for a 40 hour contract. 
    
    Plus, NMBRS has a super easy way to overview who is out of office and when, Blendle wide.  A great tool for teams and managers to plan work and availability especially around big projects or releases.
    
    **It looks weird in the system.....I see a negative balance!**

You can park your car [here](http://www.parkeren-utrecht.nl/parkeergarage-moreelsepark). Our Office Manager will get you a parking card asap (if you plan to come by car often). Until then, you can get a get-out-of-parking-stamp with her. Blendle will pay for it.

Or just come by train, we?ll get you a fancy NS business card.

When you enter on your first day, it?s probably best to team up with your teammate/buddy and sit next to or near him or her. Just know that you?re free to sit anywhere you like. Just know that further to the back (behind the meeting rooms) we like to keep things quiet. Just to keep focus :). To improve focus we have one rule called the headphone-rule. Headphones on means ""do not disturb"". Pretty straight-forward, but it works.

**Massage**

Every week on Wednesday from 12.30-16.00h (might change, see the all@ calendar), we have a masseuse come by to relieve us from stress (what stress), RSI, that aching back or tiredness. And yes its great! There is no queue, just a free-for-all.

**Headspace**
Document 4:**It looks weird in the system.....I see a negative balance!**
    
    For everyone with a 40 hours contract, the **minimum balance is set as 20 days** in NMBRS each year, and this re-sets at the start of each year.  In the case that you didn't take all 20 days by end of December (we hope this is not the case as you should take the advised minimum, at a minimum), these days will show in your balance for the next year for 6 months.
    
    (note: as we are introducing the tool in June 2020, the remaining balance is 10 for 2020, that's half of the normal balance)
    
    On the other hand, if **you exceed this minimum balance** you will show as negative in the system.  Nothing to worry about **-** remember... **we don't track your holidays in that kind of way**.  As long as your manager has agreed to your holidays and you have added your request, it's fine to go negative. 
    
    **How do I submit my holiday plans?**
    After discussing your time off with your lead and team, go to NMBRS to submit the request. To do so, log in to your [https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/](https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/) account and choose ""Verlof"". Fill in the dates, reason, save it and done!. Your lead will get a signal to approve the request through NMBRS.","Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer with references (""SOURCES"").

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

What is the process for requesting a salary adjustment?,"Document 1:# People System - Salarisbalie - Requesting Time off & Expensing

Salarisbalie is our payroll specialist and makes sure we get paid correctly every month, Salarisbalie works within a tool called NMBRS. NMBRS is used for saving and monitoring all personnel files,  personal information, holidays, dossiers, contracts, etc.

    And while we don't have a maximum, we do have a **minimum** that we want you to take, to keep you healthy - 20 days each year, for a 40 hour contract. 
    
    Plus, NMBRS has a super easy way to overview who is out of office and when, Blendle wide.  A great tool for teams and managers to plan work and availability especially around big projects or releases.

What is the company's mission?,"Document 1:# What can Blendle do?

There?s a lot Blendle could improve and we?re working on that. The fact that we are a fast-paced startup with an aim to save journalism is not something that will change any time soon. This also means that we are facing a runway, which affects our everyday work. This is fuelling us to go the extra mile, but the downsides are also obvious.

So what can Blendle do?

- **Voicing vision & mission more:** everybody should feel connected to where Blendle is going and why. Talking about this more will help everybody align. This way everybody has more influence on the direction and it is more clear why a change of direction is made and how this affects your work.
- Open channels: **work on transparency and trust**: everybody should be able to speak up if they feel that the stress level is too high. Also when someone feels like they aren?t in the right role or simply doing work they don?t love everyday.
- **Build an environment which is less stressful.** This piece is step 1 on this point. Notice when people work too much. Tell people if we notice it and tell them to take action (go home, take holiday, work less, talk to someone). Let?s also keep improving the process we have in place for when people feel it?s too much.
Document 2:# Culture & Role-Modelling

This might be a given but we think it is so important that we dedicated a section to it: the soft shit. Everything that is not concrete or directly work-related, but is as important.  

- **Vision, mission and strategy**
    
    For people at Blendle, it's really important to know why they are doing what they do and what the effect or impact is. You probably constantly think and talk about why and how we do things. Don't forget that your team members often don't have that context. Here are two things to close that gap of information and context.
    
    - **Proactively share what was discussed in high-level meetings.** Also what did we decide not to do and how was the decision made (based on hypotheses or data?).
    - **Ask your team** if they know **why they are doing** what they're doing. Remind them of it if you feel the need.
- **Vibe and morale**
    
    Working in a nice and vibrant environment is important to all of us. A place where people are motivated, willing and positive. Do not underestimate the importance of this and the impact it can have on the daily work. Two things you can do:
    
    - Make it a recurring agenda point during retrospectives: how was the vibe during this sprint?
    - Address it if you feel morale is fading. It can be a red flag. Is it one person? One situation? One team? One project? Or is it more?
    
- **Culture**
Document 3:- Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

What is the headphone rule and why is it important?,"Document 1:# Office

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?lle is in charge of lunch ??ask her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

---

**Snacks and more**
Document 2:**You have the responsibility to find out what rhythm works for you best, to be at your best.** Simply because we believe not everybody works the same way. So do you have the rhythm which works best for you? We want everybody to be able to bring their child, cat or car to daycare. Not because we love cats in particular (yes we do), but we want nothing to get in your way of getting the most out of your day. The fact that we don?t care when and how many times you go to a doctor, psych or barber is not because we want to be the ?cool employer?, but because you need your health to add value that day. So if that means visiting the barber once a week on Monday morning: please do.
    
    So have you found your rhythm yet? Rolo hates traffic jams so you?ll see him coming and going at exotic times. Alex is scrolling through his Twitter feed till late at night so you won't see him before 11:00 at the office. Rick?s alarm clock is set at 6:00 and we know he doesn?t snooze, so he?s in at 8:00, leaving early to have dinner with his wife.
    
    It might help announcing changes in your rythm to your team. It makes it feel legit for you, and your team members can help you with it.
    
    When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:
Document 3:2. **Keep teams small.** More then 4-6 people creates more overhead (mainly communication like e-mail/slack and interactions in general) and doesn't necessarily mean that the team performs better. Jeff Bezos calls it the 2 pizza rule (you should be able to feed your team with 2 pizzas) and Ringelmann discovered 'social loafing' in 1914. People unintentionally slack when the group gets too big. Read more about this here:

        [What is the optimal group size for decision-making? - Sheila Margolis](https://sheilamargolis.com/2011/01/24/what-is-the-optimal-group-size-for-decision-making/)
        
    3. **Keep budget in mind.** You should focus on getting the best team for the work you need done, but budget does play a role in this. People are our most important and most expensive resource. Hiring, therefore, is an expensive solution to a problem. 
    4. **Plan.** Discuss this step with your lead and HR.
        
        To be able to plan you need these variables: Team, Role, Profile and role description, Hitlist, Priority, Scarceness (1-5), Years of relevant experience, Salary range, Planning. 
        
         Here's an example of a template we've used in the past to plan our hiring Blendle-wide:
Document 4:- You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.
    - This is a guideline.  If you have other national holidays you observe (eg Eid al-Fitr Suikerfeest, ending of Ramadan) feel free to work or be off when you want.
    
    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.
    - You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.
    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.
- **Backdrop**
    
    The law and additional ruling tell us what we can and can not do according to time off. We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:","Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer with references (""SOURCES""). 
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Don't try to make up an answer.
ALWAYS return a ""SOURCES"" part in your answer.

QUESTION: What is the headphone rule and why is it important?
=========
Content: # Office

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?lle is in charge of lunch ??ask her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

**Snacks and more**

Content: **You have the responsibility to find out what rhythm works for you best, to be at your best.** Simply because we believe not everybody works the same way. So do you have the rhythm which works best for you? We want everybody to be able to bring their child, cat or car to daycare. Not because we love cats in particular (yes we do), but we want nothing to get in your way of getting the most out of your day. The fact that we don?t care when and how many times you go to a doctor, psych or barber is not because we want to be the ?cool employer?, but because you need your health to add value that day. So if that means visiting the barber once a week on Monday morning: please do.
    
    So have you found your rhythm yet? Rolo hates traffic jams so you?ll see him coming and going at exotic times. Alex is scrolling through his Twitter feed till late at night so you won't see him before 11:00 at the office. Rick?s alarm clock is set at 6:00 and we know he doesn?t snooze, so he?s in at 8:00, leaving early to have dinner with his wife.
    
    It might help announcing changes in your rythm to your team. It makes it feel legit for you, and your team members can help you with it.
    
    When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:

Content: 2. **Keep teams small.** More then 4-6 people creates more overhead (mainly communication like e-mail/slack and interactions in general) and doesn't necessarily mean that the team performs better. Jeff Bezos calls it the 2 pizza rule (you should be able to feed your team with 2 pizzas) and Ringelmann discovered 'social loafing' in 1914. People unintentionally slack when the group gets too big.

    3. **Keep budget in mind.** You should focus on getting the best team for the work you need done, but budget does play a role in this. People are our most important and most expensive resource. Hiring, therefore, is an expensive solution to a problem. 
    4. **Plan.** Discuss this step with your lead and HR.
        
        To be able to plan you need these variables: Team, Role, Profile and role description, Hitlist, Priority, Scarceness (1-5), Years of relevant experience, Salary range, Planning. 
        
         Here's an example of a template we've used in the past to plan our hiring Blendle-wide:

Content: - You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.
    - This is a guideline.  If you have other national holidays you observe (eg Eid al-Fitr Suikerfeest, ending of Ramadan) feel free to work or be off when you want.
    
    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.
    - You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.
    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.
- **Backdrop**
    
    The law and additional ruling tell us what we can and can not do according to time off. We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:

FINAL ANSWER:","The headphone rule is a policy in the office that encourages employees to wear headphones when they need to focus and do not want to be disturbed. It allows employees to create a quiet and uninterrupted work environment for themselves. The rule is important because it helps employees maintain their concentration and productivity, allowing them to complete their tasks efficiently. It also promotes a respectful and considerate work culture where employees can work without unnecessary interruptions.",Good

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

How is the work culture?,"Document 1:# Culture & Role-Modelling

This might be a given but we think it is so important that we dedicated a section to it: the soft shit. Everything that is not concrete or directly work-related, but is as important.  

- **Vision, mission and strategy**
    
    For people at Blendle, it's really important to know why they are doing what they do and what the effect or impact is. You probably constantly think and talk about why and how we do things. Don't forget that your team members often don't have that context. Here are two things to close that gap of information and context.
    
    - **Proactively share what was discussed in high-level meetings.** Also what did we decide not to do and how was the decision made (based on hypotheses or data?).
    - **Ask your team** if they know **why they are doing** what they're doing. Remind them of it if you feel the need.
- **Vibe and morale**
    
    Working in a nice and vibrant environment is important to all of us. A place where people are motivated, willing and positive. Do not underestimate the importance of this and the impact it can have on the daily work. Two things you can do:
    
    - Make it a recurring agenda point during retrospectives: how was the vibe during this sprint?
    - Address it if you feel morale is fading. It can be a red flag. Is it one person? One situation? One team? One project? Or is it more?

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.

Officer Rivera was 22.

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.

QUESTION: How is the work culture?
=========
Content: # Culture & Role-Modelling

This might be a given but we think it is so important that we dedicated a section to it: the soft shit. Everything that is not concrete or directly work-related, but is as important.  

- **Vision, mission and strategy**
    
    For people at Blendle, it's really important to know why they are doing what they do and what the effect or impact is. You probably constantly think and talk about why and how we do things. Don't forget that your team members often don't have that context. Here are two things to close that gap of information and context.
    
    - **Proactively share what was discussed in high-level meetings.** Also what did we decide not to do and how was the decision made (based on hypotheses or data?).
    - **Ask your team** if they know **why they are doing** what they're doing. Remind them of it if you feel the need.
- **Vibe and morale**
    
    Working in a nice and vibrant environment is important to all of us. A place where people are motivated, willing and positive. Do not underestimate the importance of this and the impact it can have on the daily work. Two things you can do:
    
    - Make it a recurring agenda point during retrospectives: how was the vibe during this sprint?
    - Address it if you feel morale is fading. It can be a red flag. Is it one person? One situation? One team? One project? Or is it more?
    
- **Culture**

Content: # Office

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?lle is in charge of lunch ??ask her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

**Snacks and more**

The people themselves are the culture and we guard that culture. What you stand for, what you believe in and how we treat each other is part of our DNA.

FINAL ANSWER:","The work culture at Blendle emphasizes the importance of vision, mission, and strategy, as well as maintaining a positive and motivated environment. It encourages team members to proactively share information, address morale issues, and lead by example in terms of culture. The office provides a semi-flexible workspace and promotes focus through the use of headphones. Lunch is provided, with an emphasis on healthy options and variety. The company values influence, freedom, and the feeling that work matters and has an impact. The work environment is fast-paced and attracts responsible, driven, and ambitious individuals. Stress management is also addressed, recognizing the potential for burnout in a high-pressure startup environment.

Document 2:2. **Keep teams small.** More then 4-6 people creates more overhead (mainly communication like e-mail/slack and interactions in general) and doesn't necessarily mean that the team performs better. Jeff Bezos calls it the 2 pizza rule (you should be able to feed your team with 2 pizzas) and Ringelmann discovered 'social loafing' in 1914. People unintentionally slack when the group gets too big. Read more about this here:

    3. **Keep budget in mind.** You should focus on getting the best team for the work you need done, but budget does play a role in this. People are our most important and most expensive resource. Hiring, therefore, is an expensive solution to a problem. 
    4. **Plan.** Discuss this step with your lead and HR.
        
        To be able to plan you need these variables: Team, Role, Profile and role description, Hitlist, Priority, Scarceness (1-5), Years of relevant experience, Salary range, Planning. 
        
         Here's an example of a template we've used in the past to plan our hiring Blendle-wide:
Document 3:?In other words, I would tell the manager what everybody said but not who said it. Not because I wanted to foster secrecy, but because I wanted to help get the information out there,? says Scott. ?If there were too many things the team didn?t feel comfortable saying directly to their boss, and if it wasn?t getting better over time, that became the top thing I worked with the manager to change.?

    Just let us know if you would like one and we will organize it for you :).
    
    **Upward feedback**
    
    Something you can do yourself is asking for upward feedback using a typeform/googleform. Send these questions to your team and see where you're at:
    
    - My teamlead regularly gives me actionable feedback that helps me improve my performance.
    - My teamlead does not micromanage (i.e., get involved in details that should be handled at other levels).
    - My teamlead regularly shares relevant info and/or insights from the MT.
    - My teamlead is easy to approach with problems/concerns/feedback.
    - My teamlead communicates clear goals for our team.
    - My teamlead keeps the team focus on our priority results/deliverables/OKR?s.

Document 4:Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :). 
    

## Here's what you can do:

1. Actively **think** about the possibility that someone's time at Blendle is up. At least every month for everyone in your team.
2. **Flag** this at HR/MT when that happens. 
3. **Ask** for help if needed already at this stage.
4. **Analyse** (maybe together) the problem and give feedback to the person in question: try to get on the same page about where things go 'wrong'. These are pointers which might steer your thoughts. Real situations are always more complex. 
    - Someone is **underperforming**. Try using [the Matrix?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=0) to track down the areas where you think things should improve. Give actionable feedback and try to come up with concrete points to work on in his/her personal goals. Don't wait for the feedback cycle, the time is always now.
    - Someone **stopped growing or learning**. This isn't necessarily an immediate problem, but it can be because most people like working at Blendle because they grow and learn so much. Someone standing still for a year is a red flag.","Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer with references (""SOURCES"").

Content: 2. **Keep teams small.** More then 4-6 people creates more overhead (mainly communication like e-mail/slack and interactions in general) and doesn't necessarily mean that the team performs better. Jeff Bezos calls it the 2 pizza rule (you should be able to feed your team with 2 pizzas) and Ringelmann discovered 'social loafing' in 1914. People unintentionally slack when the group gets too big.

    3. **Keep budget in mind.** You should focus on getting the best team for the work you need done, but budget does play a role in this. People are our most important and most expensive resource. Hiring, therefore, is an expensive solution to a problem. 
    4. **Plan.** Discuss this step with your lead and HR.
        
        To be able to plan you need these variables: Team, Role, Profile and role description, Hitlist, Priority, Scarceness (1-5), Years of relevant experience, Salary range, Planning. 
        
         Here's an example of a template we've used in the past to plan our hiring Blendle-wide:

Content: ?In other words, I would tell the manager what everybody said but not who said it. Not because I wanted to foster secrecy, but because I wanted to help get the information out there,? says Scott. ?If there were too many things the team didn?t feel comfortable saying directly to their boss, and if it wasn?t getting better over time, that became the top thing I worked with the manager to change.?

    Just let us know if you would like one and we will organize it for you :).
    
    **Upward feedback**
    
    Something you can do yourself is asking for upward feedback using a typeform/googleform. Send these questions to your team and see where you're at:
    
    - My teamlead regularly gives me actionable feedback that helps me improve my performance.
    - My teamlead does not micromanage (i.e., get involved in details that should be handled at other levels).
    - My teamlead regularly shares relevant info and/or insights from the MT.
    - My teamlead is easy to approach with problems/concerns/feedback.
    - My teamlead communicates clear goals for our team.
    - My teamlead keeps the team focus on our priority results/deliverables/OKR?s.

Content: Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :). 
    

## Here's what you can do:

1. Actively **think** about the possibility that someone's time at Blendle is up. At least every month for everyone in your team.
2. **Flag** this at HR/MT when that happens. 
3. **Ask** for help if needed already at this stage.
4. **Analyse** (maybe together) the problem and give feedback to the person in question: try to get on the same page about where things go 'wrong'. These are pointers which might steer your thoughts. Real situations are always more complex. 
    - Someone is **underperforming**. Try using [the Matrix?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=0) to track down the areas where you think things should improve. Give actionable feedback and try to come up with concrete points to work on in his/her personal goals. Don't wait for the feedback cycle, the time is always now.
    - Someone **stopped growing or learning**. This isn't necessarily an immediate problem, but it can be because most people like working at Blendle because they grow and learn so much. Someone standing still for a year is a red flag.

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","Relating to team members can help a lead in several ways. It can help maintain morale and identify any issues or red flags within the team. It also allows the lead to lead by example when it comes to culture and values. Building personal relationships with team members can also provide valuable insights and improve communication and collaboration within the team. Additionally, relating to team members can help the lead understand their needs and provide support and guidance. Overall, building strong relationships with team members can contribute to a positive and productive work environment.

Document 4:# People System - Salarisbalie - Requesting Time off & Expensing

Salarisbalie is our payroll specialist and makes sure we get paid correctly every month, Salarisbalie works within a tool called NMBRS. NMBRS is used for saving and monitoring all personnel files,  personal information, holidays, dossiers, contracts, etc. 

When you start at Blendle, you get onboarded in this system. Easy peasy, everything in one place. 

You, HR and your lead have access to this self service tool.

So what can you do with Nmbrs?   Next to accessing your personal information and contracts, you can also change your contact information yourself. Plus, requesting time off and claiming expenses just became a whole lot easier: 

- **Time off request**
    
    **Why are we doing this if we have unlimited holidays?**
    The ""unlimited fair use"" rule stays. We are adding the balance for legal reasons. 
    
    And while we don't have a maximum, we do have a **minimum** that we want you to take, to keep you healthy - 20 days each year, for a 40 hour contract. 
    
    Plus, NMBRS has a super easy way to overview who is out of office and when, Blendle wide.  A great tool for teams and managers to plan work and availability especially around big projects or releases.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror.

How does the company handle employee terminations?,"Document 1:## **What you can expect from HR**

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.
Document 2:Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behavior is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn?t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions.

If you suspect that someone doesn?t realize their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when:

- Your lead, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.

## **What you can expect from HR**
Document 3:- When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.
- When people work hard, **poke them** to take time off so they recharge.
- For longer leaves of absence (~4 weeks) ping HR for advice.

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life.

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

We expect you to foster a well-organised, respectful and collaborative environment. You should avoid offending, participating in heated altercations and disrupting our workplace. We will not tolerate anyone intimidating, pestering, humiliating, victimizing or sabotaging others at Blendle. We also prohibit wilful discrimination based on age, sexual orientation, gender, ethnicity, race, religion or disability. This is by no means an exhaustive list but it gives an indication, use your common sense. You should also conform to [our inclusion and diversity policy](Diversity%20and%20Inclusion%20b8d3907631944696a4e76c2a41e757a5.md) in all aspects of your work, from recruitment and performance reviews to interpersonal relations.

Content: Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behavior is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn?t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions.

If you suspect that someone doesn?t realize their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when:

- Your lead, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.

",Good
Can I discuss my salary with my colleagues?,"Document 1:- **Off cycle salary increases**
    
    **Contract renewal** is not a moment that automatically means it is time to talk about money. We are not a company of people who demand *""give me X or I walk''*.  
    
    People can bring up salary any moment they want and we take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high) - see ""**How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?""**
    
    **Good reasons to raise offcycle**
    
    - Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.
    - Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone's impact and capabilities. It's important to be able to quantify that curve.
    - New information internally or externally.

- **How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?**
    
    We weigh up several variables:
    
    - **Benchmark:** internal and external.
        
        The most accurate way to determine the range where someone should be is comparing someone with a peer internally. During the hiring process you find out at what level someone is and you'll be able to compare him or her internally. Who would you compare this person to in terms of level? Is he/she better than X? If you notice that everyone is not as good as the people we have, but are paid more: think about raising the salary of our people. Keep in mind that - especially in tech - the market is on tilt. Big corporate pay a lot of money to even mediocare people in tech. We don't want to compete with them and that is a choice for new hires to make. 
        
    - **Classic figures:** experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise.
        
        This is a bit old school in a way, but also at Blendle there is a difference between someone who is a starter with no experience or someone with 8 years of experience. For some jobs/roles we need certain skills, expertise or even education. This always comes with a price tag.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

    **Good reasons to raise offcycle**
    
    - Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.
    - Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone's impact and capabilities. It's important to be able to quantify that curve.
    - New information internally or externally.

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","Yes, you can discuss your salary with your colleagues. The company takes it seriously if employees feel that their pay is too low or too high. However, it is important to have good reasons for requesting a raise, such as a drastic change in role and responsibilities or a steep learning curve that makes current pay unfair. It is not recommended to ask for a raise simply because a colleague got another offer or to use money as an incentive to stay. The determination of someone's salary is based on benchmarking, classic figures such as experience and education, and scarcity and market value.

Do I need permission to spend money on celebrations and learning?,"Document 1:# Party and study budget

There is money and time you can spend on celebrating stuff and for learning and development. We want you, as a Team Lead, to feel free to spend this money and time within these boundaries so you don't need permission every time you spend it on these two topics. We want to create clarity so you have the liberty?to spend money on this. We don't want to limit your thinking by coming up with a budget, so feel free to ask HR if you'd like to bend the budgets for a good reason.

You are in the lead for these two topics for your team. 

## Party budget

Apart from the Blendle-wide parties, outings and celebrations, we came up with a number for you to spend on team related stuff. **Every person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on fun stuff.** Why not ?80 or ?20? No good reason, we figured you could go out for dinner twice with your team for ?60. Every person keeps track of this for themselves.  

## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in.""
Document 2:# Learning Budget

There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely.  Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? 

Does Blendle benefit from the fact that you are spending time and money on learning and development? 

Does this fit in your personal development path at Blendle? 

Does it match personal goals? 

Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

Would you spend the money on this if it was your own?

**Talk to your Lead, and they will help decide with finance for learning budget requests.**
Document 3:## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how. Does this fit in someones personal development path at Blendle? Does it match the personal goals? Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

A good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own. The rest is common sense.

As leads you can decide to say Yes or No to budget requests based on the above questions. If you need help deciding, you can discuss with HR.

**?0-?250** = no study contract. Like a cool book, online course or a ticket to a summit.

**?250-1500 =** 12 months study contract. Like a full blown study/course or a conference (abroad).

**?1500+** = edge case with 24 months study contract, please discuss with HR.

Document 4:- You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.
    - This is a guideline.  If you have other national holidays you observe (eg Eid al-Fitr Suikerfeest, ending of Ramadan) feel free to work or be off when you want.
    
    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.
    - You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.
    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.
- **Backdrop**
    
    The law and additional ruling tell us what we can and can not do according to time off. We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:","Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer with references (""SOURCES"").

There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely.  Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? 

Does Blendle benefit from the fact that you are spending time and money on learning and development? 

Does this fit in your personal development path at Blendle? 

Does it match personal goals? 

Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

Would you spend the money on this if it was your own?

**Talk to your Lead, and they will help decide with finance for learning budget requests.**

Content: ## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how. Does this fit in someones personal development path at Blendle? Does it match the personal goals? Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

A good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own. The rest is common sense.

As leads you can decide to say Yes or No to budget requests based on the above questions. If you need help deciding, you can discuss with HR.

**?0-?250** = no study contract. Like a cool book, online course or a ticket to a summit.

**?250-1500 =** 12 months study contract. Like a full blown study/course or a conference (abroad).

**?1500+** = edge case with 24 months study contract, please discuss with HR.

Content: - You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.
    - This is a guideline.  If you have other national holidays you observe (eg Eid al-Fitr Suikerfeest, ending of Ramadan) feel free to work or be off when you want.
    
    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.
    - You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.
    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.
- **Backdrop**
    
    The law and additional ruling tell us what we can and can not do according to time off. We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:

FINAL ANSWER:","You do not need permission to spend money on celebrations and learning. However, there are certain boundaries and guidelines in place. For celebrations, each person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on team-related activities. As for learning and development, you can discuss with your Lead and finance to decide if Blendle will pitch in for your learning budget requests. The decision will be based on factors such as whether it is a good investment, if it benefits Blendle, if it aligns with personal goals and responsibilities, and if you would spend the money on it if it was your own. The specific budget for learning varies based on the type of study or course. For more information, you can discuss with HR.

What is the role of your manager in the coaching session?,"Document 1:**How?** 
    
    It works best if you have a standard agenda for this meeting. I would not recommend winging it every time. 
    
    [re:Work - Guide: Coach managers to coach](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-coach-managers-to-coach/steps/hold-effective-1-1-meetings/)
    
    Here?s an outline we like.
    
    - Personal: How are you feeling today? Why is that? What?s going on in your life at the moment? What?s on your mind?
    - Work: What are you working on? What do you like/dislike? Any roadblocks/issues?
    - Feedback and coaching: Share the feedback you wrote down. Do you have any feedback for me?
    - Goals: How are you progressing on your personal goals? Need help?
    
    *Review action points last week and make new ones*
    
    I would recommend asking your team member to come up with an agenda, to also make them feel they are in control and in the lead.
    
    Last but not least: take 15-30 minutes to prepare. Both parties shouldn?t accept the meeting going forward without preparing.
    
    We can highly recommend listening to this three part course from Manager Tools on 1:1?s. It's sometimes a bit cheesy (including the theme music) but the contents are very much worth it.

    **Skip level session:** 
    
    Also called an upward feedback session. A session where your team members sit down with your lead to talk about you. Your lead makes notes and shares them with you afterwords. 
    
    ?If you?re a manager of managers, you need to make sure that everyone on your team feels they can criticize their boss,? Scott says. But she?s quick to note that this does not mean encouraging your team to be boss killers. Instead, she recommends putting this advice into practice with a simple meeting ? commonly called a 'skip-level meeting,' though that sounds hierarchical, so she prefers to call them 'manager guidance sessions.'
    
    The process is straightforward: First, let your managers know that you?ll be scheduling a meeting with their direct reports. Get them comfortable with the idea, and make it clear that this meeting is intended to be helpful to them. Then explain the process to the reports, again making it clear that the goal of the meeting is to help their boss be a better manager ? and that the meeting is not for attribution.

    You are the gatekeeper for the performance and development of your team members. If people excel, we should reward them. If someone is underperforming we should look for solutions. We want you to flag both situations with the MT and the HR team. First step is to tell the team member yourself, but keep 'the rest' in the loop too.

    - My teamlead does not micromanage (i.e., get involved in details that should be handled at other levels).
    - My teamlead regularly shares relevant info and/or insights from the MT.
    - My teamlead is easy to approach with problems/concerns/feedback.
    - My teamlead communicates clear goals for our team.
    - My teamlead keeps the team focus on our priority results/deliverables/OKR?s.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

FINAL ANSWER:","The role of the manager in the coaching session is to hold an effective 1:1 meeting with the team member. The manager should follow a standard agenda, which includes discussing personal matters, work-related issues, providing feedback and coaching, and reviewing goals. The manager should also prepare for the meeting and encourage the team member to come up with their own agenda. Additionally, the manager can conduct skip level sessions or upward feedback sessions to gather feedback from the team.

There is money and time you can spend on celebrating stuff and for learning and development. We want you, as a Team Lead, to feel free to spend this money and time within these boundaries so you don't need permission every time you spend it on these two topics. We want to create clarity so you have the liberty?to spend money on this. We don't want to limit your thinking by coming up with a budget, so feel free to ask HR if you'd like to bend the budgets for a good reason.

You are in the lead for these two topics for your team. 

## Party budget

Apart from the Blendle-wide parties, outings and celebrations, we came up with a number for you to spend on team related stuff. **Every person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on fun stuff.** Why not ?80 or ?20? No good reason, we figured you could go out for dinner twice with your team for ?60. Every person keeps track of this for themselves.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

You are in the lead for these two topics for your team. 

## Party budget

Apart from the Blendle-wide parties, outings and celebrations, we came up with a number for you to spend on team related stuff. **Every person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on fun stuff.** Why not ?80 or ?20?

What is the process for terminating an employee?,"Document 1:## **What you can expect from HR**

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.
Document 2:Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behavior is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn?t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions.

If you suspect that someone doesn?t realize their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when:

- Your lead, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.

Document 3:# Firing

Saying goodbye to Blendle (from a colleague) and to a colleague (from Blendle) is a very normal and natural thing. When done right, it can even be a beautiful thing.

The most common situation will be when you think someone is no longer a good match with Blendle for whatever reason. This doesn't happen overnight, so try to spot situations where this is happening. 
    
    To make things clear: HR and Rick and Alex will help you with this, but we want this to be on your agenda. HR will take care of the process and paper- and legal work. Rick and Alex will help with the tough conversations. **The most important work happens months before that and that's where you come in.**
    
    Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :).
Document 4:- When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.
- When people work hard, **poke them** to take time off so they recharge.
- For longer leaves of absence (~4 weeks) ping HR for advice.

FINAL ANSWER:","The process for terminating an employee depends on the severity of the offense. If an employee is found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law, they will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation. If an employee is found guilty of sexual harassment (but not assault) by Blendle, they will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay for the first offense. Repeat offenders will be terminated after the second claim against them if the investigation concludes they are guilty. The disciplinary actions are applied uniformly to employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics. The HR department and team lead will act immediately upon receiving a complaint and will inform the employee about the disciplinary procedures and their options. The employee will have control over the process and can decide how to move forward. It is recommended to report any instances of sexual harassment to HR or the confidential counselor as soon as possible.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

",Good
What is the company's vacation policy?,"Document 1:# Taking Time off x

We kick off with the practical side of things and then dig into the idea behind it.

# Our time off policy

- Unlimited Vacation at Blendle
    - Time off is about the time you **need,** not about a **quota.**
    - At Blendle, **HR doesn't keep track** of your holidays **and we don't 'pay out' at the end of the ride.** When in doubt; less than 4 weeks is **not** enough, you may take more than that, just check with your lead if you're in doubt if it's reasonable.
    - **You can request for time off through Nmbrs** [https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/](https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/).   See People Systems section.       This way we have a handy overview of who is ooo and when. This helps when planning around bigger projects and releases etc. The overview is visible Blendle wide, cross teams. Don't worry if you end up with a negative balance, we top it up again in January! We like you to have at least 20 days off in a year. More can happen and is allowed. Here you can find more info on working with [Nmbrs](People%20System%20-%20Salarisbalie%20-%20Requesting%20Time%20off%20d436131e7b6840db95f13330ad7d3999.md)
    - You agree on your time off with your team(lead)
    - You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.
Document 2:'Time off' can be divided into two buckets:
    
    1. **Holidays and national holidays**:
        
        Your contract states you have 4 weeks of paid time off per year, by law.
        
        On average we have 8 national holidays per year. We have no CAO (collective employment agreement), which means you are not entitled to paid time off on every national holiday. We decided to follow the most common situation in an average company, which in practice means most people are off on the big national holidays. But that's your own choice, it's not a right or an obligation, so feel free to improvise. Some teams even have to (editorial and support, for example).
        
        These rules state that we are off on 'Bevrijdingsdag' once every 5 years. But we aren't allowed time off on Eid al-Fitr (Suikerfeest, ending of the Ramadan). That makes no sense to us. 
        
        So here is how we approach holidays and national holidays in practice.
        
        You 'have' 5 weeks holiday and ~8 national holidays per year. We want you to use this time off to reload but you decide when and how to consume this. You must also feel free to improvise. You work hard, maybe even a bit too hard, so you might need some extra time off to stay happy and healthy. This also works the other way around: maybe you had a chill quarter and feel no need to take a holiday: feel free to do so. We want you to think about what your body and mind needs instead of your quota.
Document 3:**Official Holidays and Vacay!**

Of course, we ain?t all workaholics, but we don?t have any CAO (collective employment agreement) with loads of bylaws. But we do have some official holidays. Be sure to check them out in the Handbook. If you want to head out to enjoy your well-deserved vacation then there is only 1 rule, and 1 rule to rule them all: check/discuss with your team and team lead.

**Holidays: time off ??**

If you haven't please take a look at the section about time off for everyone: 

[Taking Time off x](Taking%20Time%20off%20x%2000c8b7bcab1a4b1ba5d285adb774b32d.md)

- Keep in mind we don't pay out holidays at the end of the ride.
- Make sure people take enough time off (4-6 weeks per year) by bringing it up every once in a while. But: **it's their responsibility.**
- Make sure people **communicate** their time off well with the team and you. You have a say in this and you have to agree on someones time off (which will be fine in 99% of cases).
- Make sure your people put it in the **@all and their own agenda.**
- When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

QUESTION: What is the company's vacation policy?
=========
Content: # Taking Time off x

We kick off with the practical side of things and then dig into the idea behind it.

# Our time off policy

- Unlimited Vacation at Blendle
    - Time off is about the time you **need,** not about a **quota.**
    - At Blendle, **HR doesn't keep track** of your holidays **and we don't 'pay out' at the end of the ride.** When in doubt; less than 4 weeks is **not** enough, you may take more than that, just check with your lead if you're in doubt if it's reasonable.
    - **You can request for time off through Nmbrs** [https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/](https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/).   See People Systems section.       This way we have a handy overview of who is ooo and when. This helps when planning around bigger projects and releases etc. The overview is visible Blendle wide, cross teams. Don't worry if you end up with a negative balance, we top it up again in January! We like you to have at least 20 days off in a year. More can happen and is allowed. Here you can find more info on working with [Nmbrs](People%20System%20-%20Salarisbalie%20-%20Requesting%20Time%20off%20d436131e7b6840db95f13330ad7d3999.md)
    - You agree on your time off with your team(lead)
    - You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.

Content: 'Time off' can be divided into two buckets:
    
    1. **Holidays and national holidays**:
        
        Your contract states you have 4 weeks of paid time off per year, by law.
        
        On average we have 8 national holidays per year. We have no CAO (collective employment agreement), which means you are not entitled to paid time off on every national holiday. We decided to follow the most common situation in an average company, which in practice means most people are off on the big national holidays. But that's your own choice, it's not a right or an obligation, so feel free to improvise. Some teams even have to (editorial and support, for example).
        
        These rules state that we are off on 'Bevrijdingsdag' once every 5 years. But we aren't allowed time off on Eid al-Fitr (Suikerfeest, ending of the Ramadan). That makes no sense to us. 
        
        So here is how we approach holidays and national holidays in practice.
        
        You 'have' 5 weeks holiday and ~8 national holidays per year. We want you to use this time off to reload but you decide when and how to consume this. You must also feel free to improvise. You work hard, maybe even a bit too hard, so you might need some extra time off to stay happy and healthy. This also works the other way around: maybe you had a chill quarter and feel no need to take a holiday: feel free to do so. We want you to think about what your body and mind needs instead of your quota.

Content: **Official Holidays and Vacay!**

Of course, we ain?t all workaholics, but we don?t have any CAO (collective employment agreement) with loads of bylaws. But we do have some official holidays. Be sure to check them out in the Handbook. If you want to head out to enjoy your well-deserved vacation then there is only 1 rule, and 1 rule to rule them all: check/discuss with your team and team lead. For how to request time off, please read :

Your team members will sometimes not be present ?. No worries, they are just taking time off or recovering. Here's what you can do. 

**Holidays: time off ??**

If you haven't please take a look at the section about time off for everyone: 

[Taking Time off x](Taking%20Time%20off%20x%2000c8b7bcab1a4b1ba5d285adb774b32d.md)

- Your team will put a request in for time off through Nmbrs. Nmbrs will inform you through email, you can accept or decline this request by clicking the link in the email.

[People System - Salarisbalie - Requesting Time off & Expensing](People%20System%20-%20Salarisbalie%20-%20Requesting%20Time%20off%20d436131e7b6840db95f13330ad7d3999.md)

- We only track this to have a handy overview of who is off and when, for example for planning around projects and releases.
- Keep in mind we don't pay out holidays at the end of the ride.
- Make sure people take enough time off (4-6 weeks per year) by bringing it up every once in a while. But: **it's their responsibility.**
- Make sure people **communicate** their time off well with the team and you. You have a say in this and you have to agree on someones time off (which will be fine in 99% of cases).
- Make sure your people put it in the **@all and their own agenda.**
- When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","Blendle has an unlimited vacation policy. Employees are encouraged to take the time off they need, rather than adhering to a specific quota. HR does not keep track of holidays and there is no payout at the end of the year. Employees can request time off through Nmbrs and are encouraged to have at least 20 days off in a year. The company also observes commonly used national holidays. The specific vacation policy may vary depending on the team and individual agreements.

We can not stress enough how we value feedback in all its forms.?**Good feedback is at the center of all people-related topics**. Good feedback is the key to a good collaboration, happy people and even a successful company. As a lead, you are responsible for leading the feedback for your people. This section will help you do so. Look at this list as a toolkit for you and your colleagues.

- **Make notes**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Well, because you forget. Plus making notes forces you to constantly think about the feedback. We would recommend making it a habit at the end of the week (weekly review ftw!): how did X do? 
    
    If you have a good system, it will also allow you to look back. ?Didn?t we discuss this already a year ago? It?s still an issue?. It also shows that you don?t forget and take this seriously.
    
    **How?**
    
    Docs, Evernote, Todoist, Wunderlist, Word, Things or even a notebook (I would not recommend a notebook). Whatever works. Just make small notes: You did well on project X and meeting Y, because ABC. I really liked when you did X, because it had an effect on ABC. It helps you during the reviews every 6 months.
    
- **Continuous Feedback**

Content: # Leading Feedback

We can not stress enough how we value feedback in all its forms.?**Good feedback is at the center of all people-related topics**. Good feedback is the key to a good collaboration, happy people and even a successful company. As a lead, you are responsible for leading the feedback for your people. This section will help you do so. Look at this list as a toolkit for you and your colleagues. 

[Our Feedback Process](Our%20Feedback%20Process%20c40fc80d546045ffb7076797301e81a8.md)

- **Make notes**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Well, because you forget. Plus making notes forces you to constantly think about the feedback. We would recommend making it a habit at the end of the week (weekly review ftw!): how did X do? 
    
    If you have a good system, it will also allow you to look back. ?Didn?t we discuss this already a year ago? It?s still an issue?. It also shows that you don?t forget and take this seriously.
    
    **How?**
    
    Docs, Evernote, Todoist, Wunderlist, Word, Things or even a notebook (I would not recommend a notebook). Whatever works. Just make small notes: You did well on project X and meeting Y, because ABC. I really liked when you did X, because it had an effect on ABC. It helps you during the reviews every 6 months.
    
- **Continuous Feedback**
    
    **Why?**

Document 2:- Introduce your candidate by email to [People Operations or Recruitment](mailto:hr@blendle.com) and have them apply through Homerun.

The guidelines are as simple as you can imagine. If you still have any questions about how, who or what, please ask [People Operations or Recruitment.](mailto:hr@blendle.com)

The hiring managers are not eligible for bonuses when hiring for their teams. The board, People Operations and Recruitment aren?t eligible either.
Document 3:- **Off cycle salary increases**
    
    **Contract renewal** is not a moment that automatically means it is time to talk about money. We are not a company of people who demand *""give me X or I walk''*.  
    
    People can bring up salary any moment they want and we take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high) - see ""**How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?""**
    
    **Good reasons to raise offcycle**
    
    - Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.
    - Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone's impact and capabilities. It's important to be able to quantify that curve.
    - New information internally or externally.
    - New information by benchmarking studies or during hiring.
    
    **Not so good reasons to give a raise**
    
    - Colleague got another offer and uses this to get a raise.
    - 'I earn X for this company, that's a lot of money, I want a piece of the pie'.
    - Colleague just wants an incentive to stay. Money is never the answer, because it will fade - very - fast.
- **Control questions**
    
    Now before you finally decide
    
    - If we had to hire someone today for X's job, what would we pay them?
    - What would it cost Blendle as a business to find a new person (hard to replace, scarcity, time to hire, impact on day to day business & product)?

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

FINAL ANSWER:","The company offers a referral bonus to team members who help find and hire new employees. The referral bonus is offered once the new team member is hired and has been with Blendle for 1 month. The amount of the bonus depends on the position being filled, with a standard bonus of ?250 net for full-time employment or pro rata for any position, and a bonus of ?1000 net for full-time employment or pro rata for difficult-to-fill roles. Any employee at Blendle can refer a candidate for any open position by introducing the candidate to People Operations or Recruitment either through a full application or a sourcing lead. The hiring managers, board, People Operations, and Recruitment are not eligible for bonuses when hiring for their teams. The company also allows for off-cycle salary increases based on factors such as drastic changes in role and responsibilities, steep learning curves, new information internally or externally, and benchmarking studies or hiring. However, there are certain reasons that are not considered good reasons to give a raise, such as a colleague getting another offer or wanting an incentive to stay. The company encourages employees to bring up salary concerns at any time and takes them seriously. Control questions are used to help determine appropriate salary adjustments.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

FINAL ANSWER:","It is unclear whether new hires at Blendle are eligible for the 30% ruling as there is no specific information provided in the extracted parts of the document.
",
Why is culture considered to be important at Blendle?,"Document 1:- We believe being **inclusive** is important because it **fits our core values** of wanting to be a great place to work and really caring for each other. A place where people feel welcome and can be themselves. Inclusivity is crucial to our work environment and culture.
- We have trouble hiring diverse profiles. We noticed no flaws in the hiring process which would lead to favour a certain type of profile. We did notice that the 'pools' in which we are hiring (journalism and tech) are dominated by a certain profile which could explain this trend.
- We have open-minded people at Blendle who are willing and are becoming more aware.

**Some observations**:

- We tend to speak in Dutch in social settings. It can easily make non-Dutch people uncomfortable. We should speak English.
- The way we work (especially in meetings) suits extravert people better then introvert people.
- There is not a lot of variation on standard diversity variables like political views, religion, age, ethnicity, gender and educational background. Again, partly explained by the field we're in.
- Most of the leaders at Blendle are male.
- There is equal pay between men and women in the same role.
- We believe aiming for diversity numbers narrows the conversation on the topic for now. We decided to use the data to feed the conversation but not implement quotas.

**What we do:**
Document 2:- Address it if you feel morale is fading. It can be a red flag. Is it one person? One situation? One team? One project? Or is it more?
    
- **Culture**
    
    Lead by example when it comes to culture. We tried pinning down our DNA by writing down our operating principles but we came to the conclusion it's essentially all about you. The people themselves are the culture and we guard that culture. What you stand for, what you believe in and how we treat each other is part of our DNA. So be yourself and keep expressing yourself to your team. 'This is not how we do things' is a totally fine comment. Don't forget to explain why though :).
    
    Check our page about culture and values here:
    
    [Blendle value's](Blendle%20value's%2094267ed2bac24d02849d03e9ca070de6.md)
    
- **Relate and care personally**
    
    The people around you are probably one of the reasons you like working at Blendle. We are not robots, so relate to your team. As a lead, it's good to **invest in personal relationships**. This will help you in so many ways.

Document 3:# Culture & Role-Modelling

This might be a given but we think it is so important that we dedicated a section to it: the soft shit. Everything that is not concrete or directly work-related, but is as important.  

- **Vision, mission and strategy**
    
    For people at Blendle, it's really important to know why they are doing what they do and what the effect or impact is. You probably constantly think and talk about why and how we do things. Don't forget that your team members often don't have that context. Here are two things to close that gap of information and context.
    
    - **Proactively share what was discussed in high-level meetings.** Also what did we decide not to do and how was the decision made (based on hypotheses or data?).
    - **Ask your team** if they know **why they are doing** what they're doing. Remind them of it if you feel the need.
- **Vibe and morale**
    
    Working in a nice and vibrant environment is important to all of us. A place where people are motivated, willing and positive. Do not underestimate the importance of this and the impact it can have on the daily work. Two things you can do:
    
    - Make it a recurring agenda point during retrospectives: how was the vibe during this sprint?
    - Address it if you feel morale is fading. It can be a red flag. Is it one person? One situation? One team? One project? Or is it more?
    
- **Culture**
Document 4:# Blendle value's

Putting our set of values or our way of life in writing wasn't an easy task. Mainly because the moment we started putting this in writing, it already altered. We started with a set of Blendle peeps writing down every word that came to mind when thinking about Blendle. We made categories and tried making sentences out of it. We shared that with the whole group, got some good feedback and slimmed it down to 5 powerful value's.

- We believe aiming for diversity numbers narrows the conversation on the topic for now. We decided to use the data to feed the conversation but not implement quotas.

- **Culture**
    
    Lead by example when it comes to culture. We tried pinning down our DNA by writing down our operating principles but we came to the conclusion it's essentially all about you. The people themselves are the culture and we guard that culture. What you stand for, what you believe in and how we treat each other is part of our DNA. So be yourself and keep expressing yourself to your team. 'This is not how we do things' is a totally fine comment. Don't forget to explain why though :).

- **Relate and care personally**
    
    The people around you are probably one of the reasons you like working at Blendle. We are not robots, so relate to your team. As a lead, it's good to **invest in personal relationships**. This will help you in so many ways.

Content: # Culture & Role-Modelling

This might be a given but we think it is so important that we dedicated a section to it: the soft shit. Everything that is not concrete or directly work-related, but is as important.  

- **Vision, mission and strategy**
    
    For people at Blendle, it's really important to know why they are doing what they do and what the effect or impact is. You probably constantly think and talk about why and how we do things. Don't forget that your team members often don't have that context. Here are two things to close that gap of information and context.
    
    - **Proactively share what was discussed in high-level meetings.** Also what did we decide not to do and how was the decision made (based on hypotheses or data?).
    - **Ask your team** if they know **why they are doing** what they're doing. Remind them of it if you feel the need.
- **Vibe and morale**
    
    Working in a nice and vibrant environment is important to all of us. A place where people are motivated, willing and positive. Do not underestimate the importance of this and the impact it can have on the daily work. Two things you can do:
    
    - Make it a recurring agenda point during retrospectives: how was the vibe during this sprint?
    - Address it if you feel morale is fading. It can be a red flag. Is it one person? One situation? One team? One project? Or is it more?
    
- **Culture**

Content: # Blendle value's

Putting our set of values or our way of life in writing wasn't an easy task. Mainly because the moment we started putting this in writing, it already altered. We started with a set of Blendle peeps writing down every word that came to mind when thinking about Blendle. We made categories and tried making sentences out of it. We shared that with the whole group, got some good feedback and slimmed it down to 5 powerful value's.

Overall, culture is seen as an integral part of Blendle's DNA and is actively nurtured and guarded.

How many vacation days do I have left?,"Document 1:'Time off' can be divided into two buckets:
    
    1. **Holidays and national holidays**:
        
        Your contract states you have 4 weeks of paid time off per year, by law.
        
        On average we have 8 national holidays per year. We have no CAO (collective employment agreement), which means you are not entitled to paid time off on every national holiday. We decided to follow the most common situation in an average company, which in practice means most people are off on the big national holidays. But that's your own choice, it's not a right or an obligation, so feel free to improvise. Some teams even have to (editorial and support, for example).
        
        These rules state that we are off on 'Bevrijdingsdag' once every 5 years. But we aren't allowed time off on Eid al-Fitr (Suikerfeest, ending of the Ramadan). That makes no sense to us. 
        
        So here is how we approach holidays and national holidays in practice.
        
        You 'have' 5 weeks holiday and ~8 national holidays per year. We want you to use this time off to reload but you decide when and how to consume this. You must also feel free to improvise. You work hard, maybe even a bit too hard, so you might need some extra time off to stay happy and healthy. This also works the other way around: maybe you had a chill quarter and feel no need to take a holiday: feel free to do so. We want you to think about what your body and mind needs instead of your quota.
Document 2:**It looks weird in the system.....I see a negative balance!**
    
    For everyone with a 40 hours contract, the **minimum balance is set as 20 days** in NMBRS each year, and this re-sets at the start of each year.  In the case that you didn't take all 20 days by end of December (we hope this is not the case as you should take the advised minimum, at a minimum), these days will show in your balance for the next year for 6 months.
    
    (note: as we are introducing the tool in June 2020, the remaining balance is 10 for 2020, that's half of the normal balance)
    
    On the other hand, if **you exceed this minimum balance** you will show as negative in the system.  Nothing to worry about **-** remember... **we don't track your holidays in that kind of way**.  As long as your manager has agreed to your holidays and you have added your request, it's fine to go negative. 
    
    **How do I submit my holiday plans?**
    After discussing your time off with your lead and team, go to NMBRS to submit the request. To do so, log in to your [https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/](https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/) account and choose ""Verlof"". Fill in the dates, reason, save it and done!.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","The number of vacation days you have left depends on your specific contract and the company's policy. It is mentioned that employees have 4 weeks of paid time off per year by law, and there are also approximately 8 national holidays per year. However, the company does not track holidays in a traditional way and does not have a specific quota for vacation days. Instead, they have an unlimited vacation policy where employees are encouraged to take the time off they need. It is recommended to discuss your time off with your team lead and submit a request through the NMBRS system. It is also mentioned that the minimum balance for vacation days is set as 20 days in NMBRS each year. If you exceed this minimum balance, it may show as a negative balance in the system, but there is no need to worry as long as your manager has approved your holidays. It is advised to check the company's employee handbook and consult with your team lead for more specific information about your remaining vacation days.

What is the procedure for filing a complaint about a coworker or supervisor?,"Document 1:# Addressing harassment

You are *always* in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward when you report an incident. We encourage you to talk about what happened.

If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8). In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it?s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. 

Here are the steps you can take, either:

- **Talk to the offender**. If you suspect that an offender doesn?t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.
Document 2:## **What you can expect from HR**

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.
Document 3:Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behavior is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn?t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions.

If you suspect that someone doesn?t realize their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when:

- Your lead, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known.

QUESTION: What is the procedure for filing a complaint about a coworker or supervisor?
=========
Content: # Addressing harassment

You are *always* in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward when you report an incident. We encourage you to talk about what happened.

If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8). In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it?s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. 

Here are the steps you can take, either:

- **Talk to the offender**. If you suspect that an offender doesn?t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.

Content: ## **What you can expect from HR**

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.

Document 3:# Office

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?lle is in charge of lunch ??ask her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

---

**Snacks and more**
Document 4:When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:
    
    - **It is impossible to work 60 hours productively over a longer period of time.** It hurts you and Blendle to work that much. If you are able to work 8 productive hours a day you should be proud of that. Sometimes it will be 6, sometimes 10: relax, it?s okay, You?re not working in a factory with time stamps.
    - Be flexible. Some days you just don?t have it. **You are not a machine.** Of course, first you?ll take a walk and grab a double espresso or a Club Mate, but if that doesn?t work it?s okay. Go home. Go to the gym. Go play with your kid. Go kiting. Go for a walk in the forest. Anything, just don?t sit behind your desk to ?make the hours?. That?s not helping anybody.
    - Working at home vs. at Blendle HQ. Try to strike a **balance between home/office**. Meetings and brainstorms are best done face to face but a day of deep work is best done in a cafe or on an abandoned island with 4g.
    - **Rotate, change your pace.** During the summer it can be nice to start at 6:30 and bike to the beach at 15.00h. During the winter, every morning might feel like a small hangover and you stroll into HQ at 10:00 after your first 2 cups of coffee.
- **Take care of your body and mind**
    
    
    **Take holidays and days off.**","Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer with references (""SOURCES""). 
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Don't try to make up an answer.

Content: # Office

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?lle is in charge of lunch ??ask her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

**Snacks and more**

Content: When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:
    
    - **It is impossible to work 60 hours productively over a longer period of time.** It hurts you and Blendle to work that much. If you are able to work 8 productive hours a day you should be proud of that. Sometimes it will be 6, sometimes 10: relax, it?s okay, You?re not working in a factory with time stamps.
    - Be flexible. Some days you just don?t have it. **You are not a machine.** Of course, first you?ll take a walk and grab a double espresso or a Club Mate, but if that doesn?t work it?s okay. Go home. Go to the gym. Go play with your kid. Go kiting. Go for a walk in the forest. Anything, just don?t sit behind your desk to ?make the hours?. That?s not helping anybody.
    - Working at home vs. at Blendle HQ. Try to strike a **balance between home/office**. Meetings and brainstorms are best done face to face but a day of deep work is best done in a cafe or on an abandoned island with 4g.
    - **Rotate, change your pace.** During the summer it can be nice to start at 6:30 and bike to the beach at 15.00h. During the winter, every morning might feel like a small hangover and you stroll into HQ at 10:00 after your first 2 cups of coffee.
- **Take care of your body and mind**
    
    
    **Take holidays and days off.**

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","The frequency of the BIG HR People Survey at Blendle is not mentioned in the provided information.
",
How can I remind my team members of why they are doing what they're doing?,"Document 1:- **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?
    
    Are you giving praise?
    
    Are you actively challenging your team?
    
    Are you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?
    
    Are you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?
    
    Is your schedule (and that of your team) in a healthy rhythm (work-life balance)? You set the example.
    
    Is your team taking regular holidays/long weekends?
    
    Here?s an article about how to help your team with this:
Document 2:# Leading Feedback

We can not stress enough how we value feedback in all its forms.?**Good feedback is at the center of all people-related topics**. Good feedback is the key to a good collaboration, happy people and even a successful company. As a lead, you are responsible for leading the feedback for your people. This section will help you do so. Look at this list as a toolkit for you and your colleagues. 

[Our Feedback Process](Our%20Feedback%20Process%20c40fc80d546045ffb7076797301e81a8.md)

- **Make notes**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Well, because you forget. Plus making notes forces you to constantly think about the feedback. We would recommend making it a habit at the end of the week (weekly review ftw!): how did X do? 
    
    If you have a good system, it will also allow you to look back. ?Didn?t we discuss this already a year ago? It?s still an issue?. It also shows that you don?t forget and take this seriously.
    
    **How?**
    
    Docs, Evernote, Todoist, Wunderlist, Word, Things or even a notebook (I would not recommend a notebook). Whatever works. Just make small notes: You did well on project X and meeting Y, because ABC. I really liked when you did X, because it had an effect on ABC. It helps you during the reviews every 6 months.
    
- **Continuous Feedback**
    
    **Why?**
Document 3:# Culture & Role-Modelling

This might be a given but we think it is so important that we dedicated a section to it: the soft shit. Everything that is not concrete or directly work-related, but is as important.  

- **Vision, mission and strategy**
    
    For people at Blendle, it's really important to know why they are doing what they do and what the effect or impact is. You probably constantly think and talk about why and how we do things. Don't forget that your team members often don't have that context. Here are two things to close that gap of information and context.
    
    - **Proactively share what was discussed in high-level meetings.** Also what did we decide not to do and how was the decision made (based on hypotheses or data?).
    - **Ask your team** if they know **why they are doing** what they're doing. Remind them of it if you feel the need.
- **Vibe and morale**
    
    Working in a nice and vibrant environment is important to all of us. A place where people are motivated, willing and positive. Do not underestimate the importance of this and the impact it can have on the daily work. Two things you can do:
    
    - Make it a recurring agenda point during retrospectives: how was the vibe during this sprint?
    - Address it if you feel morale is fading. It can be a red flag. Is it one person? One situation? One team? One project? Or is it more?
    
- **Culture**
Document 4:**How?** 
    
    It works best if you have a standard agenda for this meeting. I would not recommend winging it every time. 
    
    [re:Work - Guide: Coach managers to coach](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-coach-managers-to-coach/steps/hold-effective-1-1-meetings/)
    
    Here?s an outline we like.
    
    - Personal: How are you feeling today? Why is that? What?s going on in your life at the moment? What?s on your mind?
    - Work: What are you working on? What do you like/dislike? Any roadblocks/issues?
    - Feedback and coaching: Share the feedback you wrote down. Do you have any feedback for me?
    - Goals: How are you progressing on your personal goals? Need help?
    
    *Review action points last week and make new ones*
    
    I would recommend asking your team member to come up with an agenda, to also make them feel they are in control and in the lead.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: How can I remind my team members of why they are doing what they're doing?
=========
Content: - **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?
    
    Are you giving praise?
    
    Are you actively challenging your team?
    
    Are you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?
    
    Are you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?
    
    Is your schedule (and that of your team) in a healthy rhythm (work-life balance)? You set the example.
    
    Is your team taking regular holidays/long weekends?
    
    Here?s an article about how to help your team with this:

Content: # Leading Feedback

We can not stress enough how we value feedback in all its forms.?**Good feedback is at the center of all people-related topics**. Good feedback is the key to a good collaboration, happy people and even a successful company. As a lead, you are responsible for leading the feedback for your people. This section will help you do so. Look at this list as a toolkit for you and your colleagues. 

[Our Feedback Process](Our%20Feedback%20Process%20c40fc80d546045ffb7076797301e81a8.md)

- **Make notes**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Well, because you forget. Plus making notes forces you to constantly think about the feedback. We would recommend making it a habit at the end of the week (weekly review ftw!): how did X do? 
    
    If you have a good system, it will also allow you to look back. ?Didn?t we discuss this already a year ago? It?s still an issue?. It also shows that you don?t forget and take this seriously.
    
    **How?**
    
    Docs, Evernote, Todoist, Wunderlist, Word, Things or even a notebook (I would not recommend a notebook). Whatever works. Just make small notes: You did well on project X and meeting Y, because ABC. I really liked when you did X, because it had an effect on ABC. It helps you during the reviews every 6 months.
    
- **Continuous Feedback**
    
    **Why?**

Content: # Culture & Role-Modelling

This might be a given but we think it is so important that we dedicated a section to it: the soft shit. Everything that is not concrete or directly work-related, but is as important.  

- **Vision, mission and strategy**
    
    For people at Blendle, it's really important to know why they are doing what they do and what the effect or impact is. You probably constantly think and talk about why and how we do things. Don't forget that your team members often don't have that context. Here are two things to close that gap of information and context.
    
    - **Proactively share what was discussed in high-level meetings.** Also what did we decide not to do and how was the decision made (based on hypotheses or data?).
    - **Ask your team** if they know **why they are doing** what they're doing. Remind them of it if you feel the need.
- **Vibe and morale**
    
    Working in a nice and vibrant environment is important to all of us. A place where people are motivated, willing and positive. Do not underestimate the importance of this and the impact it can have on the daily work. Two things you can do:
    
    - Make it a recurring agenda point during retrospectives: how was the vibe during this sprint?
    - Address it if you feel morale is fading. It can be a red flag. Is it one person? One situation? One team? One project? Or is it more?
    
- **Culture**

Content: **How?** 
    
    It works best if you have a standard agenda for this meeting. I would not recommend winging it every time. 
    
    [re:Work - Guide: Coach managers to coach](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-coach-managers-to-coach/steps/hold-effective-1-1-meetings/)
    
    Here?s an outline we like.
    
    - Personal: How are you feeling today? Why is that? What?s going on in your life at the moment? What?s on your mind?
    - Work: What are you working on? What do you like/dislike? Any roadblocks/issues?
    - Feedback and coaching: Share the feedback you wrote down. Do you have any feedback for me?
    - Goals: How are you progressing on your personal goals? Need help?
    
    *Review action points last week and make new ones*
    
    I would recommend asking your team member to come up with an agenda, to also make them feel they are in control and in the lead.
    
    Last but not least: take 15-30 minutes to prepare. Both parties shouldn?t accept the meeting going forward without preparing.
    
    We can highly recommend listening to this three part course from Manager Tools on 1:1?s. It's sometimes a bit cheesy (including the theme music) but the contents are very much worth it.

[This video](https://youtu.be/xfZM2JuovJM?t=1941) explains a bit about pensions in general and it starts at the point where they explain what Bright Pensioen is and why we chose it. At the moment Blendle can?t afford a full blown pension plan, but we want to do what we can. That?s why Blendle pays the costs to Bright, so the money you put aside, goes straight to your pension. I also attached a presentation Bright did at Blendle.
        - **Option plan:** there is an Option plan. Options are worth a lot for us, because it is the most precious thing we have: a part of our company. So we don?t hand them out by default, we just want you to know it?s there and that we can explain the details to you later if you want.
        - **Laptop:** a good laptop is important, so you get one from us. Special needs? Let me know.
        - **Equipment:** we have electric sit-stand-desks and good chairs so your back stays in shape and there are more than enough screens and additional equipment at the office.
        - **Massages:** once a week, our masseuse gets rid of all our stress with her chair massages.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

How does Blendle benefit from employees spending time and money on learning and development?,"Document 1:# Learning Budget

There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely.  Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? 

Does Blendle benefit from the fact that you are spending time and money on learning and development? 

Does this fit in your personal development path at Blendle? 

Does it match personal goals? 

Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

Would you spend the money on this if it was your own?

**Talk to your Lead, and they will help decide with finance for learning budget requests.**
Document 2:## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how. Does this fit in someones personal development path at Blendle? Does it match the personal goals? Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

A good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own. The rest is common sense.

As leads you can decide to say Yes or No to budget requests based on the above questions. If you need help deciding, you can discuss with HR.

**?0-?250** = no study contract. Like a cool book, online course or a ticket to a summit.

**?250-1500 =** 12 months study contract. Like a full blown study/course or a conference (abroad).

**?1500+** = edge case with 24 months study contract, please discuss with HR.

Document 4:- **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?
    
    Are you giving praise?
    
    Are you actively challenging your team?
    
    Are you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?
    
    Are you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: How does Blendle benefit from employees spending time and money on learning and development?
=========
Content: # Learning Budget

There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely.  Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? 

Does Blendle benefit from the fact that you are spending time and money on learning and development? 

Does this fit in your personal development path at Blendle? 

Does it match personal goals? 

Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

Would you spend the money on this if it was your own?

**Talk to your Lead, and they will help decide with finance for learning budget requests.**

Content: ## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how. Does this fit in someones personal development path at Blendle? Does it match the personal goals? Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

A good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own. The rest is common sense.

As leads you can decide to say Yes or No to budget requests based on the above questions. If you need help deciding, you can discuss with HR.

**?0-?250** = no study contract. Like a cool book, online course or a ticket to a summit.

**?250-1500 =** 12 months study contract. Like a full blown study/course or a conference (abroad).

**?1500+** = edge case with 24 months study contract, please discuss with HR.

Content: - **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?
    
    Are you giving praise?
    
    Are you actively challenging your team?
    
    Are you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?
    
    Are you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?
    
    Is your schedule (and that of your team) in a healthy rhythm (work-life balance)? You set the example.
    
    Is your team taking regular holidays/long weekends?

Content: - **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?
    
    Are you giving praise?
    
    Are you actively challenging your team?
    
    Are you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?
    
    Are you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?
    
    Is your schedule (and that of your team) in a healthy rhythm (work-life balance)? You set the example.
    
    Is your team taking regular holidays/long weekends?

    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.

    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.

    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.

Salarisbalie is our payroll specialist and makes sure we get paid correctly every month, Salarisbalie works within a tool called NMBRS. NMBRS is used for saving and monitoring all personnel files,  personal information, holidays, dossiers, contracts, etc. 

When you start at Blendle, you get onboarded in this system. Easy peasy, everything in one place. 

You, HR and your lead have access to this self service tool.

So what can you do with Nmbrs?   Next to accessing your personal information and contracts, you can also change your contact information yourself. Plus, requesting time off and claiming expenses just became a whole lot easier: 

- **Time off request**
    
    **Why are we doing this if we have unlimited holidays?**
    The ""unlimited fair use"" rule stays. We are adding the balance for legal reasons. 
    
    And while we don't have a maximum, we do have a **minimum** that we want you to take, to keep you healthy - 20 days each year, for a 40 hour contract. 
    
    Plus, NMBRS has a super easy way to overview who is out of office and when, Blendle wide.  A great tool for teams and managers to plan work and availability especially around big projects or releases.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Content: # Calling in sick/better

1. You are ill/sick or had an accident and **can not work.**

3. **Update everyone** on how you are feeling if it takes longer then expected. Stay home until you are better.
4. **Let everyone know** when you are back.

FYI:

- **Your lead calls you in sick with the [Arbo](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8),** which is important for insurance and legal purposes.
- Arbo helps us (you and Blendle) in case we need advice or help. They have counsols and doctors on speed dial if needed, visit our [Arbo page](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) for the information.
- If you call in sick more then 3 times in a year, that is considered above average, so Arbo advises us to check in with you if you are alright. We will.
- Don't feel guilty for being sick.
- Go to the doctor in time if you need to. Don't act tough.
- If you have weird or vague complaints over a longer period of time like headaches, bad sleep or panic-related stuff. Check your stress level.
- **You want to call or e-mail our direct contact at Arbo directly, you can find the contact details [right here](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8)** (not public)

What is the policy on tracking work hours at Blendle?,"Document 1:- You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.
    - This is a guideline.  If you have other national holidays you observe (eg Eid al-Fitr Suikerfeest, ending of Ramadan) feel free to work or be off when you want.
    
    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.
    - You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.
    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.

- Unlimited Vacation at Blendle
    - Time off is about the time you **need,** not about a **quota.**
    - At Blendle, **HR doesn't keep track** of your holidays **and we don't 'pay out' at the end of the ride.** When in doubt; less than 4 weeks is **not** enough, you may take more than that, just check with your lead if you're in doubt if it's reasonable.
    - **You can request for time off through Nmbrs** [https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/](https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/).   See People Systems section.       This way we have a handy overview of who is ooo and when. This helps when planning around bigger projects and releases etc. The overview is visible Blendle wide, cross teams. Don't worry if you end up with a negative balance, we top it up again in January! We like you to have at least 20 days off in a year. More can happen and is allowed. Here you can find more info on working with [Nmbrs](People%20System%20-%20Salarisbalie%20-%20Requesting%20Time%20off%20d436131e7b6840db95f13330ad7d3999.md)

- **Blendle outings:** 
the party agenda is pretty full. You?ll be invited when there is a party ahead.
- **Flexible Holidays:** 
we think 4-6 weeks off per year is kinda the sweet spot, with at least once 2 weeks in a row. So that?s what we put in your contract.

we want you to find out what works for you best. Just know that we don't keep track of hours. We trust you.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

How should team members communicate their time off?,"Document 1:# Holidays x

Your team members will sometimes not be present ?. No worries, they are just taking time off or recovering. Here's what you can do. 

**Holidays: time off ??**

If you haven't please take a look at the section about time off for everyone: 

[Taking Time off x](Taking%20Time%20off%20x%2000c8b7bcab1a4b1ba5d285adb774b32d.md)

- Your team will put a request in for time off through Nmbrs. Nmbrs will inform you through email, you can accept or decline this request by clicking the link in the email.

[People System - Salarisbalie - Requesting Time off & Expensing](People%20System%20-%20Salarisbalie%20-%20Requesting%20Time%20off%20d436131e7b6840db95f13330ad7d3999.md)

- We only track this to have a handy overview of who is off and when, for example for planning around projects and releases.
- Keep in mind we don't pay out holidays at the end of the ride.
- Make sure people take enough time off (4-6 weeks per year) by bringing it up every once in a while. But: **it's their responsibility.**
- Make sure people **communicate** their time off well with the team and you. You have a say in this and you have to agree on someones time off (which will be fine in 99% of cases).
- Make sure your people put it in the **@all and their own agenda.**
- When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.
Document 2:- When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.
- When people work hard, **poke them** to take time off so they recharge.
- For longer leaves of absence (~4 weeks) ping HR for advice.

# Work at Blendle

If you want to work at Blendle you can check our [job ads here](https://blendle.homerun.co/). If you want to be kept in the loop about Blendle, you can sign up for [our behind the scenes newsletter](https://blendle.homerun.co/yes-keep-me-posted/tr/apply?token=8092d4128c306003d97dd3821bad06f2)
Document 3:## **The conversation**

Try initiating an open conversation by scheduling a meet on the first day of return to work, or at least as soon as you can. The purpose behind this conversation is not to judge someone for being absent. But it's meant to uncover the factors behind, or the cause of the absence. There is a good chance that you or Blendle can prevent the next absence by talking about this.

**Explain why you are having this conversation**

- Don't ask right away about the problems and sickness. Make clear that it's about being absent.
- Share a list of dates and patterns relevant to being absent.
- Talk about how the absence worries you, how it effects the team and anyone close to the team member.

**How to and what questions to ask:**

[Google Slides - create and edit presentations online, for free.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11TAG83sZkoXBBGi8pIOVTnYq0fyR5SkzuQUDZN4bQUk/edit#slide=id.p17)

**Notes**

- Always ask open questions.
- Know your facts, this will prevent unnecessary discussions. You can ask HR for the statics.
- Let your team member steer you towards the right solutions, don't fill in the blanks.
- Take notes, set goals and share them with each other afterwards.
- Monitor the progress, have recurring conversations about the situation and the goals.
- There is a fine barrier between being too pushy and being truly engaged and it's normal to feel that dilemma. Just use your own judgement.
Document 4:- You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.
    - This is a guideline.  If you have other national holidays you observe (eg Eid al-Fitr Suikerfeest, ending of Ramadan) feel free to work or be off when you want.
    
    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.
    - You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.
    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.
- **Backdrop**
    
    The law and additional ruling tell us what we can and can not do according to time off. We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:","Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer with references (""SOURCES""). 
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Don't try to make up an answer.
ALWAYS return a ""SOURCES"" part in your answer.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

QUESTION: How should team members communicate their time off?
=========
Content: # Holidays x

Your team members will sometimes not be present ?. No worries, they are just taking time off or recovering. Here's what you can do. 

**Holidays: time off ??**

If you haven't please take a look at the section about time off for everyone: 

[Taking Time off x](Taking%20Time%20off%20x%2000c8b7bcab1a4b1ba5d285adb774b32d.md)

- Your team will put a request in for time off through Nmbrs. Nmbrs will inform you through email, you can accept or decline this request by clicking the link in the email.

[People System - Salarisbalie - Requesting Time off & Expensing](People%20System%20-%20Salarisbalie%20-%20Requesting%20Time%20off%20d436131e7b6840db95f13330ad7d3999.md)

- We only track this to have a handy overview of who is off and when, for example for planning around projects and releases.
- Keep in mind we don't pay out holidays at the end of the ride.
- Make sure people take enough time off (4-6 weeks per year) by bringing it up every once in a while. But: **it's their responsibility.**
- Make sure people **communicate** their time off well with the team and you. You have a say in this and you have to agree on someones time off (which will be fine in 99% of cases).
- Make sure your people put it in the **@all and their own agenda.**
- When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.

Content: - When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.
- When people work hard, **poke them** to take time off so they recharge.
- For longer leaves of absence (~4 weeks) ping HR for advice.

Content: ## **The conversation**

Try initiating an open conversation by scheduling a meet on the first day of return to work, or at least as soon as you can. The purpose behind this conversation is not to judge someone for being absent. But it's meant to uncover the factors behind, or the cause of the absence. There is a good chance that you or Blendle can prevent the next absence by talking about this.

**Explain why you are having this conversation**

- Don't ask right away about the problems and sickness. Make clear that it's about being absent.
- Share a list of dates and patterns relevant to being absent.
- Talk about how the absence worries you, how it effects the team and anyone close to the team member.

**How to and what questions to ask:**

[Google Slides - create and edit presentations online, for free.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11TAG83sZkoXBBGi8pIOVTnYq0fyR5SkzuQUDZN4bQUk/edit#slide=id.p17)

**Notes**

- Always ask open questions.
- Know your facts, this will prevent unnecessary discussions. You can ask HR for the statics.
- Let your team member steer you towards the right solutions, don't fill in the blanks.
- Take notes, set goals and share them with each other afterwards.
- Monitor the progress, have recurring conversations about the situation and the goals.
- There is a fine barrier between being too pushy and being truly engaged and it's normal to feel that dilemma. Just use your own judgement.

Content: - You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.
    - This is a guideline.  If you have other national holidays you observe (eg Eid al-Fitr Suikerfeest, ending of Ramadan) feel free to work or be off when you want.
    
    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.
    - You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.
    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.
- **Backdrop**
    
    The law and additional ruling tell us what we can and can not do according to time off. We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

In the case that you didn't take all 20 days by end of December (we hope this is not the case as you should take the advised minimum, at a minimum), these days will show in your balance for the next year for 6 months.
    
    (note: as we are introducing the tool in June 2020, the remaining balance is 10 for 2020, that's half of the normal balance)
    
    On the other hand, if **you exceed this minimum balance** you will show as negative in the system.  Nothing to worry about **-** remember... **we don't track your holidays in that kind of way**.  As long as your manager has agreed to your holidays and you have added your request, it's fine to go negative. 
    
    **How do I submit my holiday plans?**
    After discussing your time off with your lead and team, go to NMBRS to submit the request. To do so, log in to your [https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/](https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/) account and choose ""Verlof"". Fill in the dates, reason, save it and done!. Your lead will get a signal to approve the request through NMBRS.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.
