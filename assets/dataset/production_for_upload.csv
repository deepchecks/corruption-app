QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life.

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.

FINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.

QUESTION: Why is it important for team leads to communicate changes in roles or job demands?
=========
Content: - Someone's **role is no longer a match**. Roles, jobs and their demands change. They aren't static. Pay attention to changing roles and put effort into telling your people what changed instead of implicitly expecting people to understand what changed. A changing role can be a reason for someone to no longer be the perfect match. Tell someone what we expect from them, make it clear. Work together to match those new demands but be honest if it doesn't work.
        
        This also works the other way around: some roles don't change, but people do. 
        
    - Someone wants to **grow in a different direction**. Blendle is still a small company so we can't just offer every possible career path. Use 1 on 1's to talk about someone's ambition and career path. Be honest and realistic about the possibilities at Blendle. Think about whether you think someone would be a good fit for that role and tell them what would be needed to get to that point (in terms of skills, expertise, personality, experience). The next question is whether Blendle has a role like that vacant. Be realistic and open about this.

Content: 2. **Keep teams small.** More then 4-6 people creates more overhead (mainly communication like e-mail/slack and interactions in general) and doesn't necessarily mean that the team performs better. Jeff Bezos calls it the 2 pizza rule (you should be able to feed your team with 2 pizzas) and Ringelmann discovered 'social loafing' in 1914. People unintentionally slack when the group gets too big. Read more about this here:

    3. **Keep budget in mind.** You should focus on getting the best team for the work you need done, but budget does play a role in this. People are our most important and most expensive resource. Hiring, therefore, is an expensive solution to a problem. 
    4. **Plan.** Discuss this step with your lead and HR.
        
        To be able to plan you need these variables: Team, Role, Profile and role description, Hitlist, Priority, Scarceness (1-5), Years of relevant experience, Salary range, Planning. 
        
         Here's an example of a template we've used in the past to plan our hiring Blendle-wide:

Content: We know this adds to your tally. Again, just becoming aware of this already helps.

And also again, when you see something causing a lot of stress, let?s get to work on it. Not digging the new team structure? Not feeling your current role? Not happy with your team lead? Bring it up with someone you trust (HR, your team lead, Alexander, just anyone) and let?s try to fix it or at least talk about it.

Blendle cares. We care. So if you?re struggling, let?s change things to make sure you are happy, healthy and at your best.

# 3. Make changes: here are some quick wins

- **Look at your work life balance**
    
    
    > In engineering, people talk about asset integrity, which means that you service the machinery before it breaks. In modern organizations, the work is thinking and the machinery is your brain. We know from cognitive science that there are hard limits to what the brain can deal with. And yet, there?s an awful lot in the way we work which flies in the face of that. We think that if we work through the night, we?re being very clever. We?re not. We think we can work long hours ? month after month, year after year ? and that there won?t be any wear and tear. But there is.

Content: - **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?
    
    Are you giving praise?
    
    Are you actively challenging your team?
    
    Are you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?
    
    Are you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?
    
    Is your schedule (and that of your team) in a healthy rhythm (work-life balance)? You set the example.

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","It is important for team leads to communicate changes in roles or job demands because roles and job demands can change over time. It is crucial to inform employees about these changes and make it clear what is expected from them. Additionally, team leads should discuss employees' ambitions and career paths to ensure alignment and provide realistic expectations. Effective communication about changes in roles or job demands helps maintain transparency and allows for collaboration in adapting to new demands.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror.

QUESTION: Is there a budget for study materials and learning?
=========
Content: ## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how. Does this fit in someones personal development path at Blendle? Does it match the personal goals? Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

A good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own. The rest is common sense.

As leads you can decide to say Yes or No to budget requests based on the above questions. If you need help deciding, you can discuss with HR.

**?0-?250** = no study contract. Like a cool book, online course or a ticket to a summit.

**?250-1500 =** 12 months study contract. Like a full blown study/course or a conference (abroad).

**?1500** = edge case with 24 months study contract, please discuss with HR.

Content: # Party and study budget

There is money and time you can spend on celebrating stuff and for learning and development. We want you, as a Team Lead, to feel free to spend this money and time within these boundaries so you don't need permission every time you spend it on these two topics. We want to create clarity so you have the liberty?o spend money on this. We don't want to limit your thinking by coming up with a budget, so feel free to ask HR if you'd like to bend the budgets for a good reason.

You are in the lead for these two topics for your team. 

## Party budget

Apart from the Blendle-wide parties, outings and celebrations, we came up with a number for you to spend on team related stuff. **Every person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on fun stuff.** Why not ?80 or ?20? No good reason, we figured you could go out for dinner twice with your team for ?60. Every person keeps track of this for themselves.

QUESTION: Why is it important to give input and flag performance issues?
=========
Content: Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :). 
    

## Here's what you can do:

1. Actively **think** about the possibility that someone's time at Blendle is up. At least every month for everyone in your team.
2. **Flag** this at HR/MT when that happens. 
3. **Ask** for help if needed already at this stage.
4. **Analyse** (maybe together) the problem and give feedback to the person in question: try to get on the same page about where things go 'wrong'. These are pointers which might steer your thoughts. Real situations are always more complex. 
    - Someone is **underperforming**. Try using [the Matrix?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=0) to track down the areas where you think things should improve. Give actionable feedback and try to come up with concrete points to work on in his/her personal goals. Don't wait for the feedback cycle, the time is always now.
    - Someone **stopped growing or learning**. This isn't necessarily an immediate problem, but it can be because most people like working at Blendle because they grow and learn so much. Someone standing still for a year is a red flag.

We want you to flag both situations with the MT and the HR team. First step is to tell the team member yourself, but keep 'the rest' in the loop too. 
    
    Don't wait for a review cycle or contract which expires to give this a thought.

- Don?t save all your feedback up - give at the time of the event (or shortly after) -  There should be no surprises
- Don't make it personal.  Focus on the situation not the person. and how you can work together to improve it for next time.
- Examples are fine, but don't use them for the blame game.
- Reflect on your intention in giving someone your feedback. Are you giving it to help someone or to shame someone?  Did you have a role in the situation that happened?
- Be clear and direct, subtle gibberish doesn't help anyone.
- Remember A-P-P-R-E-C-I-A-T-I-O-N helps motivate and shows people their unique value.

? Tips for r**eceiving feedback**

</aside>

- Always assume feedback is given to help you
- Be open to listening and don't get stuck in a spiral of defending or pointing fingers back.
Take responsibility if something went wrong and focus on learning how to work together better.
- Be curious - Why is this feedback given to you? What is really at the root of it?  Is it the feedback itself that indicates a problem or is some emotion underlying it that needs to be addressed?

Content: We know this adds to your tally. Again, just becoming aware of this already helps.

And also again, when you see something causing a lot of stress, let?s get to work on it. Not digging the new team structure? Not feeling your current role? Not happy with your team lead? Bring it up with someone you trust (HR, your team lead, Alexander, just anyone) and let?s try to fix it or at least talk about it.

Blendle cares. We care. So if you?re struggling, let?s change things to make sure you are happy, healthy and at your best.

# 3. Make changes: here are some quick wins

    > In engineering, people talk about asset integrity, which means that you service the machinery before it breaks. In modern organizations, the work is thinking and the machinery is your brain. We know from cognitive science that there are hard limits to what the brain can deal with. And yet, there?s an awful lot in the way we work which flies in the face of that. We think that if we work through the night, we?re being very clever. We?re not. We think we can work long hours ? month after month, year after year ? and that there won?t be any wear and tear. But there is.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more.

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror.

QUESTION: Who does Blendle work with for migration and relocation services?
=========
Content: # Highly Skilled Migrants and relocation

Blendle has been a [""recognised sponsor""](https://ind.nl/en/Forms/3084.pdf) by IND sinds 2018. This means we are allowed to employ highly skilled knowledge migrants and relocate them to the Netherlands.

Blendle offers highly skilled migrants a great relocation package and compensations. For the migration and relocation part, Blendle works with [Expat Management Group](https://www.expatmanagementgroup.com/). EMG has a dedicated team involved for the coordination and assistance in immigration, relocation and tax services.

## Blendle Relocation package

- We take care of the work- and residence permits and all the fees (children and spouse included).
- We book the flight(s) to the Netherlands.
- We pay an extra relocation fee to help with the extra expenses.
- We arrange and pay for the first month of temporary accommodation.
- We assist with permanent housing. Like helping with the search, negotiations and settling in.
- We assist with the 30% ruling tax application.

What we offer is flexible and can be adjusted to certain personal needs. But we highly recommend to stick with this all-in-one package to reduce any hassle and stress when relocating to the Netherlands.

### Where to start
Source: Notion_DB\Blendle's Employee Handbook a834d55573614857a48a9ce9ec4194e3\Highly Skilled Migrants and relocation 12927cf6a820413492eacde35992d19f.md

Content: ### Where to start

We can basically hire anyone from anywhere in the world. But the migration and relocation procedure will be different for some countries. It's good to know that the migration procedure and relocation can take up to 8 weeks. So when interviewing a new candidate, that should be something to be aware of.  The information below should give you a good idea of what the differences are between different countries. 

As a lead, if you want to move forward with a candidate and make an offer, please contact HR for support first. In general the procedure looks like something like this:

1. There is a green light after the pair session;
2. Contact HR to discuss the salary, startdate and the relocation offer. In some cases HR needs to contact EMG in advance to check some legal stuff;
3. You have a ""yes"" from our candidate? HR can take over from here and will start the procedure with EMG;
4. HR will keep you up to date and help you with the on-boarding;
5. HR needs to be up to date about renewals or any other significant changes in salary or contract. These things have consequences for the work permit of our new colleague.

## Some important reminders

- It can take up to 8 weeks before a new hire can actually start working at Blendle.
- It's important to inform the candidates about the (lack of) housing in Utrecht, be realistic.
- We offer a relocation packages which can be customised within some boundries.

QUESTION: What steps does Blendle take to encourage more diverse profiles to apply?
=========
Content: - We believe being **inclusive** is important because it **fits our core values** of wanting to be a great place to work and really caring for each other. A place where people feel welcome and can be themselves. Inclusivity is crucial to our work environment and culture.
- We have trouble hiring diverse profiles. We noticed no flaws in the hiring process which would lead to favour a certain type of profile. We did notice that the 'pools' in which we are hiring (journalism and tech) are dominated by a certain profile which could explain this trend.
- We have open-minded people at Blendle who are willing and are becoming more aware.

**Some observations**:

- We tend to speak in Dutch in social settings. It can easily make non-Dutch people uncomfortable. We should speak English.
- The way we work (especially in meetings) suits extravert people better then introvert people.
- There is not a lot of variation on standard diversity variables like political views, religion, age, ethnicity, gender and educational background. Again, partly explained by the field we're in.
- Most of the leaders at Blendle are male.
- There is equal pay between men and women in the same role.
- We believe aiming for diversity numbers narrows the conversation on the topic for now. We decided to use the data to feed the conversation but not implement quotas.

**What we do:**

Content: # Diversity and Inclusion

It was this ^^ picture from our Christmas party three years ago which got us some replies on Twitter. A lot of males and a lot of white. We know that we need to do better to make Blendle a more diverse workplace. We spend a lot of time thinking about diversity and inclusion. After reading, talking and listening, we learned a few things:

- This is a sensitive topic: feelings and opinions are involved.
- This is a trending topic: there is a lot of noise and it's hard to pin down the essence.
- This is not a new, but renewed topic.
- Diversity and inclusion is more of a scale than a simple yes or no statement.
- Everyone is biased and every company is at risk of becoming less diverse and inclusive.
- A more diverse and inclusive company **>** a less diverse and inclusive company for a lot of reasons.
- Diversity and inclusion is not 'just' about gender or race, so looking at just those numbers can limit your thoughts on this topic. The practical side of this topic is also way more subtle.

**Diversity and inclusion at Blendle**

What we know now:

- We believe in the importance of a **diverse** team because we believe **it's crucial to our succes and product.** We try to add meaning to peoples everyday life by helping them reach quality content instead of cat gifs on Facebook. This can only be done by a group of people with different backgrounds, expertise, personalities, talents, ideas and opinions.

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","Blendle takes several steps to encourage more diverse profiles to apply. They recognize the importance of inclusivity and creating a welcoming environment. They acknowledge the lack of diversity in certain fields and are working to address this issue. They also strive to be open-minded and are becoming more aware of the need for diversity. However, they do not implement quotas and believe that aiming for diversity numbers narrows the conversation on the topic. They use data to inform the conversation but do not set specific diversity targets. They also acknowledge the need to create a more inclusive work culture, such as speaking English in social settings to make non-Dutch people feel more comfortable. They are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive workplace and recognize the value it brings to their success and product.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: Do we pay out holidays at the end of the year?
=========
Content: 'Time off' can be divided into two buckets:
    
    1. **Holidays and national holidays**:
        
        Your contract states you have 4 weeks of paid time off per year, by law.
        
        On average we have 8 national holidays per year. We have no CAO (collective employment agreement), which means you are not entitled to paid time off on every national holiday. We decided to follow the most common situation in an average company, which in practice means most people are off on the big national holidays. But that's your own choice, it's not a right or an obligation, so feel free to improvise. Some teams even have to (editorial and support, for example).
        
        These rules state that we are off on 'Bevrijdingsdag' once every 5 years. But we aren't allowed time off on Eid al-Fitr (Suikerfeest, ending of the Ramadan). That makes no sense to us. 
        
        So here is how we approach holidays and national holidays in practice.
        
        You 'have' 5 weeks holiday and ~8 national holidays per year. We want you to use this time off to reload but you decide when and how to consume this. You must also feel free to improvise. You work hard, maybe even a bit too hard, so you might need some extra time off to stay happy and healthy. This also works the other way around: maybe you had a chill quarter and feel no need to take a holiday: feel free to do so. We want you to think about what your body and mind needs instead of your quota.

Be sure to check them out in the Handbook. If you want to head out to enjoy your well-deserved vacation then there is only 1 rule, and 1 rule to rule them all: check/discuss with your team and team lead. For how to request time off, please read :

Your team members will sometimes not be present ?. No worries, they are just taking time off or recovering. Here's what you can do. 

**Holidays: time off ??**

If you haven't please take a look at the section about time off for everyone: 

[Taking Time off x](Taking%20Time%20off%20x%2000c8b7bcab1a4b1ba5d285adb774b32d.md)

- Your team will put a request in for time off through Nmbrs. Nmbrs will inform you through email, you can accept or decline this request by clicking the link in the email.

- We only track this to have a handy overview of who is off and when, for example for planning around projects and releases.
- Keep in mind we don't pay out holidays at the end of the ride.
- Make sure people take enough time off (4-6 weeks per year) by bringing it up every once in a while. But: **it's their responsibility.**
- Make sure people **communicate** their time off well with the team and you. You have a say in this and you have to agree on someones time off (which will be fine in 99% of cases).
- Make sure your people put it in the **@all and their own agenda.**
- When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.

Content: **It looks weird in the system.....I see a negative balance!**
    
    For everyone with a 40 hours contract, the **minimum balance is set as 20 days** in NMBRS each year, and this re-sets at the start of each year.  In the case that you didn't take all 20 days by end of December (we hope this is not the case as you should take the advised minimum, at a minimum), these days will show in your balance for the next year for 6 months.
    
    (note: as we are introducing the tool in June 2020, the remaining balance is 10 for 2020, that's half of the normal balance)
    
    On the other hand, if **you exceed this minimum balance** you will show as negative in the system.  Nothing to worry about **-** remember... **we don't track your holidays in that kind of way**.  As long as your manager has agreed to your holidays and you have added your request, it's fine to go negative. 
    
    **How do I submit my holiday plans?**
    After discussing your time off with your lead and team, go to NMBRS to submit the request. To do so, log in to your [https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/](https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/) account and choose ""Verlof"". Fill in the dates, reason, save it and done!. Your lead will get a signal to approve the request through NMBRS.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life.

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known.

    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.

Content: # People System - Salarisbalie - Requesting Time off & Expensing

Salarisbalie is our payroll specialist and makes sure we get paid correctly every month, Salarisbalie works within a tool called NMBRS. NMBRS is used for saving and monitoring all personnel files,  personal information, holidays, dossiers, contracts, etc. 

When you start at Blendle, you get onboarded in this system. Easy peasy, everything in one place. 

You, HR and your lead have access to this self service tool.

So what can you do with Nmbrs?   Next to accessing your personal information and contracts, you can also change your contact information yourself. Plus, requesting time off and claiming expenses just became a whole lot easier: 

- **Time off request**
    
    **Why are we doing this if we have unlimited holidays?**
    The ""unlimited fair use"" rule stays. We are adding the balance for legal reasons. 
    
    And while we don't have a maximum, we do have a **minimum** that we want you to take, to keep you healthy - 20 days each year, for a 40 hour contract. 
    
    Plus, NMBRS has a super easy way to overview who is out of office and when, Blendle wide.  A great tool for teams and managers to plan work and availability especially around big projects or releases.
    
    **It looks weird in the system.....I see a negative balance!**

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

    - **Week 1:** Make sure to **sit down with your lead** in the first few days to get to know each other and talk about expectations [and goals for the 1st month](http://goals.blendle.io/) and the 1st quarter (see below for a structure). Make sure to schedule your week 2 and week 4 check-ins.
    - **Week 2: Have a check-in** regarding expectations and goals. If there are doubts (from both sides): this is the time to say it. If there are severe doubts, think about scheduling another check-in next week (week 3).
    - **Week 4: Have a check-in** regarding expectations and goals. Your trial period ends and you wrap up your first month together. It's important to come up with a few personal goals in this talk. Think about feedback you got and things you would like to achieve, learn or do at Blendle. After this, you will receive continuous feedback and will be involved in the feedback cycle like everyone. This is also a good moment to schedule your weekly or bi-weekly 1on1's with your lead.

Content: **How?** 
    
    It works best if you have a standard agenda for this meeting. I would not recommend winging it every time. 
    
    [re:Work - Guide: Coach managers to coach](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-coach-managers-to-coach/steps/hold-effective-1-1-meetings/)
    
    Here?s an outline we like.
    
    - Personal: How are you feeling today? Why is that? What?s going on in your life at the moment? What?s on your mind?
    - Work: What are you working on? What do you like/dislike? Any roadblocks/issues?
    - Feedback and coaching: Share the feedback you wrote down. Do you have any feedback for me?
    - Goals: How are you progressing on your personal goals? Need help?
    
    *Review action points last week and make new ones*
    
    I would recommend asking your team member to come up with an agenda, to also make them feel they are in control and in the lead.
    
    Last but not least: take 15-30 minutes to prepare. Both parties shouldn?t accept the meeting going forward without preparing.
    
    We can highly recommend listening to this three part course from Manager Tools on 1:1?s. It's sometimes a bit cheesy (including the theme music) but the contents are very much worth it.

Content: - **Continuous Feedback**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Don?t save up feedback, it?s less powerful. Just speak your mind. The more often you do this, the easier it gets. This goes both ways: good and bad. I never heard someone say he or she got too much feedback.
    
    **How?** 
    
    Face to face is best (e-mail/slack/chat is ok for practical stuff).
    
    Praise in public, feedback 1on1.
    
    Think about:
    
    - quality of work: you did well on X. Because ABC.
    - way of working: you were slow and distracted, how can I help?
    - behaviour: try not to interrupt people during the meeting.
    
    There are a lot of tips out there on how to give feedback.
    
    I like the HIP-approach:
    
    - **H**umble
    - **H**elpful
    - **I**mmediate
    - **I**n person
    - **P**rivate criticism/ **P**ublic Praise
    - Not about **P**ersonality

    [A HIP Approach to Feedback | Achieve Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/a-hip-approach-to-feedback/)
    
- **Have scheduled (bi-)weekly 1on1's**
    
    **Why?**
    
    It?s important and it's not going to happen if you don?t schedule it. If all is fine it might feel too much. It isn?t. Goal is to ?stay in touch? and simply have a relationship with someone. The relationship is the basis for being able to give good feedback and it makes it easier to receive too.

**Good news:** you can do something.

# 1. Check yourself:

When looking at all the things stated in chapter 3, you might recognize some stuff. In addition you can fill in this self test: 

[Burnout Self-Test: Are You at Risk?](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTCS_08.htm)

So how are you?

[]()

- I'm good!
    
    Great, take some time to realize why you are doing fine and take measures in order to prevent yourself from getting to stressed.
    
- I?m okay-ish, but something needs to change.
    - Start by telling your team lead that you feel like you have been on your toes for a while and you think you need time to recover. Also tell your team. Also tell HR.
    - Come up with a concrete 2 week plan (we can help you with that) to release some of the first pressure. This will mean a less busy sprint, shorter days, and maybe 2 weeks of 4 days to start with (or a holiday). The hours you gain, you can spend on things you enjoy and help you reload (Netflix, sports, cinema, go to the beach, visit friends, play with model trains). We learned that just doing nothing, doesn?t always help, so make sure to spend time on things you like.
    - During these two weeks you check in with your team lead how your stress level is. You can make it really concrete by giving your stress level a number (1-10).

Content: ## **The conversation**

Try initiating an open conversation by scheduling a meet on the first day of return to work, or at least as soon as you can. The purpose behind this conversation is not to judge someone for being absent. But it's meant to uncover the factors behind, or the cause of the absence. There is a good chance that you or Blendle can prevent the next absence by talking about this.

**Explain why you are having this conversation**

- Don't ask right away about the problems and sickness. Make clear that it's about being absent.
- Share a list of dates and patterns relevant to being absent.
- Talk about how the absence worries you, how it effects the team and anyone close to the team member.

**How to and what questions to ask:**

**Notes**

- Always ask open questions.
- Know your facts, this will prevent unnecessary discussions. You can ask HR for the statics.
- Let your team member steer you towards the right solutions, don't fill in the blanks.
- Take notes, set goals and share them with each other afterwards.
- Monitor the progress, have recurring conversations about the situation and the goals.
- There is a fine barrier between being too pushy and being truly engaged and it's normal to feel that dilemma. Just use your own judgement.

    It works best if you have a standard agenda for this meeting. I would not recommend winging it every time. 
    
    [re:Work - Guide: Coach managers to coach](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-coach-managers-to-coach/steps/hold-effective-1-1-meetings/)
    
    Here?s an outline we like.
    
    - Personal: How are you feeling today? Why is that? What?s going on in your life at the moment? What?s on your mind?
    - Work: What are you working on? What do you like/dislike? Any roadblocks/issues?
    - Feedback and coaching: Share the feedback you wrote down. Do you have any feedback for me?
    - Goals: How are you progressing on your personal goals? Need help?
    
    *Review action points last week and make new ones*
    
    I would recommend asking your team member to come up with an agenda, to also make them feel they are in control and in the lead.
    
    Last but not least: take 15-30 minutes to prepare. Both parties shouldn?t accept the meeting going forward without preparing.
    
    We can highly recommend listening to this three part course from Manager Tools on 1:1?s. It's sometimes a bit cheesy (including the theme music) but the contents are very much worth it.

    **Drive questions** (these apply to all roles)
    
    What makes you get up out of bed every morning? What makes you tick?
    
    If you would have your own company, what would it do/make/create?

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","In the first few days, you should sit down with your lead to get to know each other and discuss expectations and goals for the first month and the first quarter. It is also important to schedule check-ins for week 2 and week 4. Additionally, you should discuss sickness absence with your lead, explaining why you are having the conversation and sharing relevant dates and patterns. It is recommended to ask open questions, know the facts, and let your team member steer towards the right solutions. Finally, you should have a standard agenda for your meetings with your team member, covering personal, work, feedback and coaching, and goals topics. It is also recommended to ask your team member to come up with an agenda and to take time to prepare for the meeting. Some overall work questions and tailored questions for specific roles can also be discussed.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: When can I expect a salary increase?
=========
Content: - **Off cycle salary increases**
    
    **Contract renewal** is not a moment that automatically means it is time to talk about money. We are not a company of people who demand *""give me X or I walk''*.  
    
    People can bring up salary any moment they want and we take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high) - see ""**How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?""**
    
    **Good reasons to raise offcycle**
    
    - Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.
    - Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone's impact and capabilities. It's important to be able to quantify that curve.
    - New information internally or externally.
    - New information by benchmarking studies or during hiring.
    
    **Not so good reasons to give a raise**
    
    - Colleague got another offer and uses this to get a raise.
    - 'I earn X for this company, that's a lot of money, I want a piece of the pie'.
    - Colleague just wants an incentive to stay. Money is never the answer, because it will fade - very - fast.
- **Control questions**
    
    Now before you finally decide
    
    - If we had to hire someone today for X's job, what would we pay them?
    - What would it cost Blendle as a business to find a new person (hard to replace, scarcity, time to hire, impact on day to day business & product)?

Content: - **Scarcity & market value.**
        
        It's fair to say that it's harder to fill some positions compared to some other roles. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.
        
    - **Role and responsibilities.**
        
        Certain roles and people make more impact than others. This is reflected in pay.
        
    - **Actual impact and contribution**
        
        Since we don't really like job titles, it's good to look at someone's actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? Can we try to put that in numbers or concrete projects?
        
    - **Someone's starting point**
        
        If we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.
        
    
    *Note: all of this is not an exact science and is determined together, so please: ask for help.*
    
- **When do we talk about money?**
    - **Yearly company wide salary raises in January**
        
        Every year (in January) we take a good look at all the salaries at Cafeyn- Blendle. Right after the feedback cycle (which we use as input) we have salary talks with everyone. We chose to do this once a year so we don't have a constant conversation about money through the year.
        
- **Off cycle salary increases**

Content: - What would it cost Blendle as a business to find a new person (hard to replace, scarcity, time to hire, impact on day to day business & product)?
    - Giving a raise to an individual changes the salary house, so keep that in mind when you decide on a raise. Does this apply to more people?

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","You can bring up the topic of a salary increase at any time if you feel that your pay is too low or unfair based on your role, responsibilities, impact, or market value. However, the company conducts yearly salary raises in January for all employees. Off-cycle salary increases may be considered for reasons such as a drastic change in role and responsibilities, a steep learning curve, new information internally or externally, or benchmarking studies. It is important to have a discussion about the cost to the company of finding a new person and the impact on the salary structure before deciding on a raise.

Content: # Our Feedback Process

> At Blendle we value the **Freedom** and **Responsibility** of giving **Proactive** and **Honest** feedback to drive excellent **Team Work**.   We try to build input points into everything we do.  We even got feedback on upgrading our Feedback process - all of which is incorporated into the new process below.
> 

# **Typical Feedback Moments @ Blendle:**

- **Sprint retro** - every 2 weeks.  How did the cycle go?  What did we learn? How did we feel?
- **Agile Process retro** - Monthly.  How can we improve the process and collaboration?
- **BIG HR People Surve**y - two times a year Q1 and Q4 on Employee experience.
- **EVERYDAY!**

# The **Quarterly Coaching Feedback Process**

At least every Quarter we want to make sure you get a formal feedback and coaching conversation focused on your personal and professional development, and progress.  And luckily, the quarterly process aligns to the timing of our Objectives Goals Strategies Measures, so you can chat about both with your manager at the same time.

### The Process:

**YOU** run ***your*** process - End to End.  By having full ownership you control your development (that ****responsible** value again ?) and focus on **teamwork** **and ****honesty ****by discussing feedback together (rather than through your manager).  So you're developing from the development process itself!

Content: # Leading Feedback

We can not stress enough how we value feedback in all its forms.?*Good feedback is at the center of all people-related topics**. Good feedback is the key to a good collaboration, happy people and even a successful company. As a lead, you are responsible for leading the feedback for your people. This section will help you do so. Look at this list as a toolkit for you and your colleagues. 

[Our Feedback Process](Our%20Feedback%20Process%20c40fc80d546045ffb7076797301e81a8.md)

- **Make notes**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Well, because you forget. Plus making notes forces you to constantly think about the feedback. We would recommend making it a habit at the end of the week (weekly review ftw!): how did X do? 
    
    If you have a good system, it will also allow you to look back. ?Didn?t we discuss this already a year ago? It?s still an issue?. It also shows that you don?t forget and take this seriously.
    
    **How?**
    
    Docs, Evernote, Todoist, Wunderlist, Word, Things or even a notebook (I would not recommend a notebook). Whatever works. Just make small notes: You did well on project X and meeting Y, because ABC. I really liked when you did X, because it had an effect on ABC. It helps you during the reviews every 6 months.
    
- **Continuous Feedback**
    
    **Why?**

- Don?t save all your feedback up - give at the time of the event (or shortly after) -  There should be no surprises
- Don't make it personal.  Focus on the situation not the person. and how you can work together to improve it for next time.
- Examples are fine, but don't use them for the blame game.
- Reflect on your intention in giving someone your feedback. Are you giving it to help someone or to shame someone?  Did you have a role in the situation that happened?
- Be clear and direct, subtle gibberish doesn't help anyone.
- Remember A-P-P-R-E-C-I-A-T-I-O-N helps motivate and shows people their unique value.

<aside>
? Tips for r**eceiving feedback**

</aside>

- Always assume feedback is given to help you
- Be open to listening and don't get stuck in a spiral of defending or pointing fingers back.
Take responsibility if something went wrong and focus on learning how to work together better.
- Be curious - Why is this feedback given to you? What is really at the root of it?  Is it the feedback itself that indicates a problem or is some emotion underlying it that needs to be addressed?

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","The purpose of the self-assessment in the feedback process is to allow individuals to evaluate their own performance and provide input on their strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. It is a way for individuals to reflect on their own work and contribute to the feedback and coaching conversation with their manager. The self-assessment helps in comparing one's own assessment to peer feedback and identifying areas of alignment or discrepancy. It also serves as a basis for setting up a coaching session with the manager to discuss development plans.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Content: - **Telephone costs/reimbursements:** if you need to make a lot of phone calls for Blendle, we?ll reimburse your costs. Same goes for other costs.
        - **Pension:** we facilitate pensions via [Bright Pensioen](https://brightpensioen.nl/). Bright is not your standard pension plan. We think it?s better than the mandatory corporate pension scheme which you might be used to. [This video](https://youtu.be/xfZM2JuovJM?t=1941) explains a bit about pensions in general and it starts at the point where they explain what Bright Pensioen is and why we chose it. At the moment Blendle can?t afford a full blown pension plan, but we want to do what we can. That?s why Blendle pays the costs to Bright, so the money you put aside, goes straight to your pension. I also attached a presentation Bright did at Blendle.
        - **Option plan:** there is an Option plan. Options are worth a lot for us, because it is the most precious thing we have: a part of our company. So we don?t hand them out by default, we just want you to know it?s there and that we can explain the details to you later if you want.
        - **Laptop:** a good laptop is important, so you get one from us. Special needs? Let me know.
        - **Equipment:** we have electric sit-stand-desks and good chairs so your back stays in shape and there are more than enough screens and additional equipment at the office.
        - **Massages:** once a week, our masseuse gets rid of all our stress with her chair massages.

QUESTION: What steps does Blendle take to fight bias in hiring?
=========
Content: - We believe being **inclusive** is important because it **fits our core values** of wanting to be a great place to work and really caring for each other. A place where people feel welcome and can be themselves. Inclusivity is crucial to our work environment and culture.
- We have trouble hiring diverse profiles. We noticed no flaws in the hiring process which would lead to favour a certain type of profile. We did notice that the 'pools' in which we are hiring (journalism and tech) are dominated by a certain profile which could explain this trend.
- We have open-minded people at Blendle who are willing and are becoming more aware.

**Some observations**:

- We tend to speak in Dutch in social settings. It can easily make non-Dutch people uncomfortable. We should speak English.
- The way we work (especially in meetings) suits extravert people better then introvert people.
- There is not a lot of variation on standard diversity variables like political views, religion, age, ethnicity, gender and educational background. Again, partly explained by the field we're in.
- Most of the leaders at Blendle are male.
- There is equal pay between men and women in the same role.
- We believe aiming for diversity numbers narrows the conversation on the topic for now. We decided to use the data to feed the conversation but not implement quotas.

**What we do:**

Content: # What can Blendle do?

There?s a lot Blendle could improve and we?re working on that. The fact that we are a fast-paced startup with an aim to save journalism is not something that will change any time soon. This also means that we are facing a runway, which affects our everyday work. This is fuelling us to go the extra mile, but the downsides are also obvious.

So what can Blendle do?

- **Voicing vision & mission more:** everybody should feel connected to where Blendle is going and why. Talking about this more will help everybody align. This way everybody has more influence on the direction and it is more clear why a change of direction is made and how this affects your work.
- Open channels: **work on transparency and trust**: everybody should be able to speak up if they feel that the stress level is too high. Also when someone feels like they aren?t in the right role or simply doing work they don?t love everyday.
- **Build an environment which is less stressful.** This piece is step 1 on this point. Notice when people work too much. Tell people if we notice it and tell them to take action (go home, take holiday, work less, talk to someone). Let?s also keep improving the process we have in place for when people feel it?s too much.

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","Blendle takes several steps to fight bias in hiring. They prioritize inclusivity and creating a welcoming work environment. They acknowledge the lack of diversity in certain fields and are working on hiring more diverse profiles. They also recognize the need for open-mindedness and awareness among their employees. However, they do not implement quotas for diversity numbers. They are committed to having conversations about diversity and using data to inform those conversations.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: How can I request time off for vacations or holidays?
=========
Content: # Holidays x

Your team members will sometimes not be present ?. No worries, they are just taking time off or recovering. Here's what you can do. 

**Holidays: time off ??**

If you haven't please take a look at the section about time off for everyone: 

[Taking Time off x](Taking%20Time%20off%20x%2000c8b7bcab1a4b1ba5d285adb774b32d.md)

- Your team will put a request in for time off through Nmbrs. Nmbrs will inform you through email, you can accept or decline this request by clicking the link in the email.

[People System - Salarisbalie - Requesting Time off & Expensing](People%20System%20-%20Salarisbalie%20-%20Requesting%20Time%20off%20d436131e7b6840db95f13330ad7d3999.md)

- We only track this to have a handy overview of who is off and when, for example for planning around projects and releases.
- Keep in mind we don't pay out holidays at the end of the ride.
- Make sure people take enough time off (4-6 weeks per year) by bringing it up every once in a while. But: **it's their responsibility.**
- Make sure people **communicate** their time off well with the team and you. You have a say in this and you have to agree on someones time off (which will be fine in 99% of cases).
- Make sure your people put it in the **@all and their own agenda.**
- When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.

Content: **Official Holidays and Vacay!**

Of course, we ain?t all workaholics, but we don?t have any CAO (collective employment agreement) with loads of bylaws. But we do have some official holidays. Be sure to check them out in the Handbook. If you want to head out to enjoy your well-deserved vacation then there is only 1 rule, and 1 rule to rule them all: check/discuss with your team and team lead. For how to request time off, please read :

**Your payslip** 

After onboarding, you'll receive an email from info@salarisbalie.nl: (also called Nmbrs)

Content: 'Time off' can be divided into two buckets:
    
    1. **Holidays and national holidays**:
        
        Your contract states you have 4 weeks of paid time off per year, by law.
        
        On average we have 8 national holidays per year. We have no CAO (collective employment agreement), which means you are not entitled to paid time off on every national holiday. We decided to follow the most common situation in an average company, which in practice means most people are off on the big national holidays. But that's your own choice, it's not a right or an obligation, so feel free to improvise. Some teams even have to (editorial and support, for example).
        
        These rules state that we are off on 'Bevrijdingsdag' once every 5 years. But we aren't allowed time off on Eid al-Fitr (Suikerfeest, ending of the Ramadan). That makes no sense to us. 
        
        So here is how we approach holidays and national holidays in practice.
        
        You 'have' 5 weeks holiday and ~8 national holidays per year. We want you to use this time off to reload but you decide when and how to consume this. You must also feel free to improvise. You work hard, maybe even a bit too hard, so you might need some extra time off to stay happy and healthy. This also works the other way around: maybe you had a chill quarter and feel no need to take a holiday: feel free to do so. We want you to think about what your body and mind needs instead of your quota.

Content: - When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.
- When people work hard, **poke them** to take time off so they recharge.
- For longer leaves of absence (~4 weeks) ping HR for advice.

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.

        - **Pension:** we facilitate pensions via [Bright Pensioen](https://brightpensioen.nl/). Bright is not your standard pension plan.

[This video](https://youtu.be/xfZM2JuovJM?t=1941) explains a bit about pensions in general and it starts at the point where they explain what Bright Pensioen is and why we chose it. At the moment Blendle can?t afford a full blown pension plan, but we want to do what we can. That?s why Blendle pays the costs to Bright, so the money you put aside, goes straight to your pension. I also attached a presentation Bright did at Blendle.
        - **Option plan:** there is an Option plan. Options are worth a lot for us, because it is the most precious thing we have: a part of our company. So we don?t hand them out by default, we just want you to know it?s there and that we can explain the details to you later if you want.
        - **Laptop:** a good laptop is important, so you get one from us. Special needs? Let me know.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

    There are 2 types of candidates:

    There is a different approach in the first step. 
    
- **1. Application/interest and first review/screening**
    
    **Who is responsible:** hiring manager
    
    **Who is involved:** whole hiring team
    
    **Goal:** focus on filtering on hard variables (work) to filter out the best potential candidates.
    
    **Timing follow-up:** within a week
    
    **How:**
    
    - **People who applied ? review application ? ask input hiring team ? turn down or invite/phone screen**
    - **People who were sourced ? review information ? ask input hiring team ? invite/phone screen**: we only approach people who we think are really interesting so if we approach someone and he/she is interested, we always invite them for a cup of coffee.

**Recruitment**

This might be one of the most important questions: Who would you like to work with? You might have noticed: we?re expanding! While trying to conquer the world, we need to gather our own army of super-duper extraterrestrial-powered heroes (you know them as your colleagues). We still have a lot of vacancies open? but apart from them, we?re always looking for new recruits. So, do you know anyone fitting the (or a) profile? Let them know we?re looking for ?em or let HR know they need to contact them.

**Business intelligence**

Sounds cool. It is. We want everybody to be informed and make the best decisions possible because all the intel is available. This is also a great way to be transparant. You get all the tools you need and acces to all the data. [Go to this page (made by the BI peeps) and go nuts](https://www.notion.so/8f7739b14e754f7194992ce9b34d0d07) (not public).

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life.

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.

Officer Rivera was 22.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.

QUESTION: What are the benefits of giving continuous feedback?
=========
Content: - **Continuous Feedback**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Don?t save up feedback, it?s less powerful. Just speak your mind. The more often you do this, the easier it gets. This goes both ways: good and bad. I never heard someone say he or she got too much feedback.
    
    **How?** 
    
    Face to face is best (e-mail/slack/chat is ok for practical stuff).
    
    Praise in public, feedback 1on1.
    
    Think about:
    
    - quality of work: you did well on X. Because ABC.
    - way of working: you were slow and distracted, how can I help?
    - behaviour: try not to interrupt people during the meeting.
    
    There are a lot of tips out there on how to give feedback.
    
    I like the HIP-approach:
    
    - **H**umble
    - **H**elpful
    - **I**mmediate
    - **I**n person
    - **P**rivate criticism/ **P**ublic Praise
    - Not about **P**ersonality
    
    Source:
    
    [A HIP Approach to Feedback | Achieve Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/a-hip-approach-to-feedback/)
    
- **Have scheduled (bi-)weekly 1on1's**
    
    **Why?**
    
    It?s important and it's not going to happen if you don?t schedule it. If all is fine it might feel too much. It isn?t. Goal is to ?stay in touch? and simply have a relationship with someone. The relationship is the basis for being able to give good feedback and it makes it easier to receive too.
    
    **How?**

Content: # Leading Feedback

We can not stress enough how we value feedback in all its forms.?*Good feedback is at the center of all people-related topics**. Good feedback is the key to a good collaboration, happy people and even a successful company. As a lead, you are responsible for leading the feedback for your people. This section will help you do so. Look at this list as a toolkit for you and your colleagues. 

[Our Feedback Process](Our%20Feedback%20Process%20c40fc80d546045ffb7076797301e81a8.md)

- **Make notes**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Well, because you forget. Plus making notes forces you to constantly think about the feedback. We would recommend making it a habit at the end of the week (weekly review ftw!): how did X do? 
    
    If you have a good system, it will also allow you to look back. ?Didn?t we discuss this already a year ago? It?s still an issue?. It also shows that you don?t forget and take this seriously.
    
    **How?**
    
    Docs, Evernote, Todoist, Wunderlist, Word, Things or even a notebook (I would not recommend a notebook). Whatever works. Just make small notes: You did well on project X and meeting Y, because ABC. I really liked when you did X, because it had an effect on ABC. It helps you during the reviews every 6 months.

Content: Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :). 
    

## Here's what you can do:

1. Actively **think** about the possibility that someone's time at Blendle is up. At least every month for everyone in your team.
2. **Flag** this at HR/MT when that happens. 
3. **Ask** for help if needed already at this stage.
4. **Analyse** (maybe together) the problem and give feedback to the person in question: try to get on the same page about where things go 'wrong'. These are pointers which might steer your thoughts. Real situations are always more complex. 
    - Someone is **underperforming**. Try using [the Matrix?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=0) to track down the areas where you think things should improve. Give actionable feedback and try to come up with concrete points to work on in his/her personal goals. Don't wait for the feedback cycle, the time is always now.
    - Someone **stopped growing or learning**. This isn't necessarily an immediate problem, but it can be because most people like working at Blendle because they grow and learn so much. Someone standing still for a year is a red flag.

- Don?t save all your feedback up - give at the time of the event (or shortly after) -  There should be no surprises
- Don't make it personal.  Focus on the situation not the person. and how you can work together to improve it for next time.
- Examples are fine, but don't use them for the blame game.
- Reflect on your intention in giving someone your feedback. Are you giving it to help someone or to shame someone?  Did you have a role in the situation that happened?
- Be clear and direct, subtle gibberish doesn't help anyone.
- Remember A-P-P-R-E-C-I-A-T-I-O-N helps motivate and shows people their unique value.

<aside>
? Tips for r**eceiving feedback**

</aside>

- Always assume feedback is given to help you
- Be open to listening and don't get stuck in a spiral of defending or pointing fingers back.
Take responsibility if something went wrong and focus on learning how to work together better.
- Be curious - Why is this feedback given to you? What is really at the root of it?  Is it the feedback itself that indicates a problem or is some emotion underlying it that needs to be addressed?

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","The benefits of giving continuous feedback include the ability to address issues in a timely manner, the opportunity for growth and improvement, and the strengthening of relationships and communication. It is recommended to provide feedback regularly and in person, focusing on the quality of work, way of working, and behavior. Taking notes can help in remembering and tracking feedback, and using a HIP approach (Humble, Helpful, Immediate, In person, Private criticism/Public Praise, Not about Personality) can be effective. Scheduled 1on1 meetings are also important for maintaining relationships and facilitating feedback.

QUESTION: What is the policy on moonlighting or having a second job?
=========
Content: - You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.
    - This is a guideline.  If you have other national holidays you observe (eg Eid al-Fitr Suikerfeest, ending of Ramadan) feel free to work or be off when you want.
    
    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.
    - You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.
    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.
- **Backdrop**
    
    The law and additional ruling tell us what we can and can not do according to time off. We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:

Content: 2. **Life events:** 
        
        Life happens. Your cat dies, your car broke, you move to another city, you get married or have kids. Life events which all need your attention. We decided that we are not going to decide for you how much time you **get** for certain events. The question is: how much time do you actually **need.** 
        
        Most companies don't give you time off for funerals that are not for immediate relatives. We think we don't need a rule to tell us if that funeral is important for you. So take the time you need.
        
    
- Edge cases
    - Sabbatical: check with HR if you for example have plans to take a very long trip (longer then ~4 weeks).

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known.

QUESTION: What are the company's policies on vacation and paid time off?
=========
Content: 'Time off' can be divided into two buckets:
    
    1. **Holidays and national holidays**:
        
        Your contract states you have 4 weeks of paid time off per year, by law.
        
        On average we have 8 national holidays per year. We have no CAO (collective employment agreement), which means you are not entitled to paid time off on every national holiday. We decided to follow the most common situation in an average company, which in practice means most people are off on the big national holidays. But that's your own choice, it's not a right or an obligation, so feel free to improvise. Some teams even have to (editorial and support, for example).
        
        These rules state that we are off on 'Bevrijdingsdag' once every 5 years. But we aren't allowed time off on Eid al-Fitr (Suikerfeest, ending of the Ramadan). That makes no sense to us. 
        
        So here is how we approach holidays and national holidays in practice.
        
        You 'have' 5 weeks holiday and ~8 national holidays per year. We want you to use this time off to reload but you decide when and how to consume this. You must also feel free to improvise. You work hard, maybe even a bit too hard, so you might need some extra time off to stay happy and healthy. This also works the other way around: maybe you had a chill quarter and feel no need to take a holiday: feel free to do so. We want you to think about what your body and mind needs instead of your quota.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

QUESTION: What are some agenda topics for 1-on-1 meetings?
=========
Content: **How?** 
    
    It works best if you have a standard agenda for this meeting. I would not recommend winging it every time. 
    
    [re:Work - Guide: Coach managers to coach](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-coach-managers-to-coach/steps/hold-effective-1-1-meetings/)
    
    Here?s an outline we like.
    
    - Personal: How are you feeling today? Why is that? What?s going on in your life at the moment? What?s on your mind?
    - Work: What are you working on? What do you like/dislike? Any roadblocks/issues?
    - Feedback and coaching: Share the feedback you wrote down. Do you have any feedback for me?
    - Goals: How are you progressing on your personal goals? Need help?
    
    *Review action points last week and make new ones*
    
    I would recommend asking your team member to come up with an agenda, to also make them feel they are in control and in the lead.
    
    Last but not least: take 15-30 minutes to prepare. Both parties shouldn?t accept the meeting going forward without preparing.
    
    We can highly recommend listening to this three part course from Manager Tools on 1:1?s. It's sometimes a bit cheesy (including the theme music) but the contents are very much worth it.

    What do you think of the current proposition?
    
    Do you communicate differently with designers than you do with engineers? What?s the difference?

    What makes you get up out of bed every morning? What makes you tick?
    
    If you would have your own company, what would it do/make/create?

Content: ## **The conversation**

Try initiating an open conversation by scheduling a meet on the first day of return to work, or at least as soon as you can. The purpose behind this conversation is not to judge someone for being absent. But it's meant to uncover the factors behind, or the cause of the absence. There is a good chance that you or Blendle can prevent the next absence by talking about this.

**Explain why you are having this conversation**

- Don't ask right away about the problems and sickness. Make clear that it's about being absent.
- Share a list of dates and patterns relevant to being absent.
- Talk about how the absence worries you, how it effects the team and anyone close to the team member.

**How to and what questions to ask:**

**Notes**

- Always ask open questions.
- Know your facts, this will prevent unnecessary discussions. You can ask HR for the statics.
- Let your team member steer you towards the right solutions, don't fill in the blanks.
- Take notes, set goals and share them with each other afterwards.
- Monitor the progress, have recurring conversations about the situation and the goals.
- There is a fine barrier between being too pushy and being truly engaged and it's normal to feel that dilemma. Just use your own judgement.

QUESTION: What is the procedure for reporting harassment or discrimination?
=========
Content: # Addressing harassment

You are *always* in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward when you report an incident. We encourage you to talk about what happened.

If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8). In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it?s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. 

Here are the steps you can take, either:

- **Talk to the offender**. If you suspect that an offender doesn?t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.

Content: ## **What you can expect from HR**

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.

Content: Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behavior is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn?t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions.

If you suspect that someone doesn?t realize their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when:

- Your lead, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.

For your safety, contact HR as soon as possible in cases of serious harassment (e.g. sexual advances) or if your team lead is involved in your claim. Anything you disclose will remain confidential.
- **Talk to a confidential counsellor**. If for any reason you don't want to talk to HR or your team lead directly, you can choose to talk to our outside counsellor. We appointed one in November 2018. The outside counsellor can listen to you and advise you on possible next steps. Again, you will always be in the lead on next steps. The content of your conversation will always stay confidential and will not reach Blendle or the offender. You can contact our counsellor directly by [email or phone (not a public link)](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8).

If you report assault to the police, Blendle will provide any possible support until the matter is resolved. In any case, we will ensure you are not victimised and that you have access to relevant evidence.

## **What's not acceptable at Blendle**

Harassment includes bullying, intimidation, direct insults, malicious gossip and victimisation. It?s impossible to create an exhaustive list, but here are some instances that we consider harassment:

- Sabotaging someone?s work on purpose
- Engaging in frequent or unwanted advances of any nature

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","To report harassment or discrimination, employees can take the following steps:

1. Talk to the offender directly if the harassment is minor or if the offender may not realize their behavior is wrong.
2. Talk to their team lead and provide as much detail as possible about the situation, including any evidence.
3. Report the incident to HR, who will act immediately and inform the employee about their options and the disciplinary procedures.
4. If the harassment involves sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favors under threats, the employee should also contact the police and inform HR of their intention to press charges.
5. Employees can also choose to talk to an outside confidential counselor appointed by the company if they prefer not to speak directly to HR or their team lead.
6. Blendle will provide support and ensure that the employee is not victimized and has access to relevant evidence if they report assault to the police.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more.

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known.

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.

    - Editorial/content
        1. **Create a daily, high quality newsletter**
        
        You probably need some practice, so need to start one week before the actual start of the beta. It's important that we see growth, i.e. ""the newsletter is becoming better on a day by day basis""
        
        **2. Hire a team of awesome editors**
        
        Including 1-2 editors from different backgrounds.

        Involve your lead in how to best get this done - they have a lot of useful connections here.
        
        Find at least 3 curators for every channel in the American kiosk (I'd say: the more the merrier). Rest will be filled by the editorial team.

    - **Week 1:** Make sure to **sit down with your lead** in the first few days to get to know each other and talk about expectations [and goals for the 1st month](http://goals.blendle.io/) and the 1st quarter (see below for a structure). Make sure to schedule your week 2 and week 4 check-ins.
    - **Week 2: Have a check-in** regarding expectations and goals. If there are doubts (from both sides): this is the time to say it. If there are severe doubts, think about scheduling another check-in next week (week 3).
    - **Week 4: Have a check-in** regarding expectations and goals. Your trial period ends and you wrap up your first month together. It's important to come up with a few personal goals in this talk. Think about feedback you got and things you would like to achieve, learn or do at Blendle. After this, you will receive continuous feedback and will be involved in the feedback cycle like everyone. This is also a good moment to schedule your weekly or bi-weekly 1on1's with your lead.

Content: - **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?
    
    Are you giving praise?
    
    Are you actively challenging your team?
    
    Are you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?
    
    Are you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?
    
    Is your schedule (and that of your team) in a healthy rhythm (work-life balance)? You set the example.
    
    Is your team taking regular holidays/long weekends?

Content: # Our Feedback Process

> At Blendle we value the **Freedom** and **Responsibility** of giving **Proactive** and **Honest** feedback to drive excellent **Team Work**.   We try to build input points into everything we do.  We even got feedback on upgrading our Feedback process - all of which is incorporated into the new process below.
> 

# **Typical Feedback Moments @ Blendle:**

- **Sprint retro** - every 2 weeks.  How did the cycle go?  What did we learn? How did we feel?
- **Agile Process retro** - Monthly.  How can we improve the process and collaboration?
- **BIG HR People Surve**y - two times a year Q1 and Q4 on Employee experience.
- **EVERYDAY!**

# The **Quarterly Coaching Feedback Process**

At least every Quarter we want to make sure you get a formal feedback and coaching conversation focused on your personal and professional development, and progress.  And luckily, the quarterly process aligns to the timing of our Objectives Goals Strategies Measures, so you can chat about both with your manager at the same time.

### The Process:

**YOU** run ***your*** process - End to End.  By having full ownership you control your development (that ****responsible** value again ?) and focus on **teamwork** **and ****honesty ****by discussing feedback together (rather than through your manager).  So you're developing from the development process itself!

    **Timing follow-up:** asap
    
    **Goal:** all-round assessment and selling
    
    **How:**
    
    Format pair day (example):
    
    Most important part is that the whole hiring team gets together to make a hiring decision. Could be the end of the day, could be the next day. Everybody should have a rating 1-3 on Work Drive and Fit  reasoning. 
    
    The meeting format: *on the count of three* show 1, 2 or 3 fingers for Work (your rating). Discuss the ratings. Do the same for Drive and Fit. 
    
    End with an *on the count of three:* show thumbs up or thumbs down on hiring. Hiring decisions should be conclusive.

    **Who is responsible**: hiring manager/teamlead
    
    **Who is involved**: hiring manager/teamlead
    
    **Timing follow-up:** asap
    
    **Goal:** As hiring manager you want to ensure we are hiring the right candidate. And to understand under what circumstances a candidate thrives or doesn't.
    
    **How:**
    
    The hiring manager or the hiring team will contact references before proceeding. Ask for references at the end of the pair day. You should check them before making an offer. Try at least 2 references. Write a short report of the conversation in github or homerun.

Content: ?In other words, I would tell the manager what everybody said but not who said it. Not because I wanted to foster secrecy, but because I wanted to help get the information out there,? says Scott. ?If there were too many things the team didn?t feel comfortable saying directly to their boss, and if it wasn?t getting better over time, that became the top thing I worked with the manager to change.?

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","The company's performance review process involves several steps. Employees are required to complete a self-assessment and ask for feedback from three colleagues and their manager. They can also have coffee with their teammates to clarify any questions about the feedback. After consolidating all the feedback, employees compare their self-assessment to peer feedback and prepare for a coaching session with their manager to agree on a development plan. The process is designed to promote proactive and honest feedback and drive excellent teamwork. The details of the process can be found in Blendle's Employee Handbook. Additionally, there are resources available for giving useful feedback and obtaining upward feedback.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: What are the performance evaluation criteria?
=========
Content: # Salary Review

- **How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?**
    
    We weigh up several variables:
    
    - **Benchmark:** internal and external.
        
        The most accurate way to determine the range where someone should be is comparing someone with a peer internally. During the hiring process you find out at what level someone is and you'll be able to compare him or her internally. Who would you compare this person to in terms of level? Is he/she better than X? If you notice that everyone is not as good as the people we have, but are paid more: think about raising the salary of our people. Keep in mind that - especially in tech - the market is on tilt. Big corporate pay a lot of money to even mediocare people in tech. We don't want to compete with them and that is a choice for new hires to make. 
        
    - **Classic figures:** experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise.
        
        This is a bit old school in a way, but also at Blendle there is a difference between someone who is a starter with no experience or someone with 8 years of experience. For some jobs/roles we need certain skills, expertise or even education. This always comes with a price tag. 
        
    - **Scarcity & market value.**

Content: **Who is involved**: hiring team and HR
    
    **Timing follow-up:** asap
    
    **Goal:** all-round assessment and selling
    
    **How:**
    
    Format pair day (example):
    
    Most important part is that the whole hiring team gets together to make a hiring decision. Could be the end of the day, could be the next day. Everybody should have a rating 1-3 on Work Drive and Fit  reasoning. 
    
    The meeting format: *on the count of three* show 1, 2 or 3 fingers for Work (your rating). Discuss the ratings. Do the same for Drive and Fit. 
    
    End with an *on the count of three:* show thumbs up or thumbs down on hiring. Hiring decisions should be conclusive. 
    
- **5. Reference check**
    
    **Who is responsible**: hiring manager/teamlead
    
    **Who is involved**: hiring manager/teamlead
    
    **Timing follow-up:** asap
    
    **Goal:** As hiring manager you want to ensure we are hiring the right candidate. And to understand under what circumstances a candidate thrives or doesn't.
    
    **How:**
    
    The hiring manager or the hiring team will contact references before proceeding. Ask for references at the end of the pair day. You should check them before making an offer. Try at least 2 references. Write a short report of the conversation in github or homerun.
    
    **Questions you can as a reference are for example:**
    
    - Can you describe your working relationship with this person?

Content: # Culture & Role-Modelling

This might be a given but we think it is so important that we dedicated a section to it: the soft shit. Everything that is not concrete or directly work-related, but is as important.  

- **Vision, mission and strategy**
    
    For people at Blendle, it's really important to know why they are doing what they do and what the effect or impact is. You probably constantly think and talk about why and how we do things. Don't forget that your team members often don't have that context. Here are two things to close that gap of information and context.
    
    - **Proactively share what was discussed in high-level meetings.** Also what did we decide not to do and how was the decision made (based on hypotheses or data?).
    - **Ask your team** if they know **why they are doing** what they're doing. Remind them of it if you feel the need.
- **Vibe and morale**
    
    Working in a nice and vibrant environment is important to all of us. A place where people are motivated, willing and positive. Do not underestimate the importance of this and the impact it can have on the daily work. Two things you can do:
    
    - Make it a recurring agenda point during retrospectives: how was the vibe during this sprint?
    - Address it if you feel morale is fading. It can be a red flag. Is it one person? One situation? One team? One project? Or is it more?
    
- **Culture**

Content: - What does good performance and success look like for this person? What do you expect from him/her?
    - What challenges or downsides does this role have?
    - What would you call the role? Is it an existing role (if yes: think if you can use someone as a blueprint, if no: make sure to check if our job title matches with other companies).
    - How much experience do you think this person needs? What kind and type of experience? In what kind and type of environments? Do you expect this person to be plug and play or is there room for learning and growing?
    - What could someone's career path look like at Blendle? What do we have to offer there?
    - Do you expect this person to lead a team or guild in a way?
    - What would a average week look like for this person?
    - What are examples of projects that were there the last quarter which could have been done by the new hire? What projects or topics are coming up?
    - What kind of skills, knowledge, expertise or experience does this person need? Make a distinction between must-haves and nice-to-haves. Be specific.
    - What kind of skills are lacking in the current team which this new person should bring?
    - Selling points: why would someone quit his job for this role? Think about the team, the role and Blendle.
    
    Share this with the hiring team, so everybody is on the same page on what we are looking for.

QUESTION: What is the policy on overtime pay?
=========
Content: 'Time off' can be divided into two buckets:
    
    1. **Holidays and national holidays**:
        
        Your contract states you have 4 weeks of paid time off per year, by law.
        
        On average we have 8 national holidays per year. We have no CAO (collective employment agreement), which means you are not entitled to paid time off on every national holiday. We decided to follow the most common situation in an average company, which in practice means most people are off on the big national holidays. But that's your own choice, it's not a right or an obligation, so feel free to improvise. Some teams even have to (editorial and support, for example).
        
        These rules state that we are off on 'Bevrijdingsdag' once every 5 years. But we aren't allowed time off on Eid al-Fitr (Suikerfeest, ending of the Ramadan). That makes no sense to us. 
        
        So here is how we approach holidays and national holidays in practice.
        
        You 'have' 5 weeks holiday and ~8 national holidays per year. We want you to use this time off to reload but you decide when and how to consume this. You must also feel free to improvise. You work hard, maybe even a bit too hard, so you might need some extra time off to stay happy and healthy. This also works the other way around: maybe you had a chill quarter and feel no need to take a holiday: feel free to do so. We want you to think about what your body and mind needs instead of your quota.

We kick off with the practical side of things and then dig into the idea behind it.

# Our time off policy

- Unlimited Vacation at Blendle
    - Time off is about the time you **need,** not about a **quota.**
    - At Blendle, **HR doesn't keep track** of your holidays **and we don't 'pay out' at the end of the ride.** When in doubt; less than 4 weeks is **not** enough, you may take more than that, just check with your lead if you're in doubt if it's reasonable.
    - **You can request for time off through Nmbrs** [https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/](https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/).   See People Systems section.       This way we have a handy overview of who is ooo and when. This helps when planning around bigger projects and releases etc. The overview is visible Blendle wide, cross teams. Don't worry if you end up with a negative balance, we top it up again in January! We like you to have at least 20 days off in a year. More can happen and is allowed. Here you can find more info on working with [Nmbrs](People%20System%20-%20Salarisbalie%20-%20Requesting%20Time%20off%20d436131e7b6840db95f13330ad7d3999.md)
    - You agree on your time off with your team(lead)
    - You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.

    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.

    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.
    - This is a guideline.  If you have other national holidays you observe (eg Eid al-Fitr Suikerfeest, ending of Ramadan) feel free to work or be off when you want.
    
    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.
    - You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.
    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.
- **Backdrop**
    
    The law and additional ruling tell us what we can and can not do according to time off. We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:

FINAL ANSWER:","Blendle has an unlimited vacation policy, meaning there is no specific quota for time off. Employees are encouraged to take the time off they need, with a minimum recommendation of 20 days off per year.

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

QUESTION: What are the key results for HR/recruitment team members in the first month?
=========
Content: **Get to know all HR/Recruitment/Office/PA processes and topics**
        
        - Go through all processes together with Rolo
        - Ask as many questions as you like
        - Read all documentation
        - Know where to find all information
        
        **Get in charge of all HR operations**
        
        - We still kinda need to define where your responsibilities start and end. Let's make sure that is figured out asap.
        
        **Get to know your colleagues (have meetings with key figures).**
        
        - We already made a list but it's important to have coffee with Rick, Alexander, Noortje, Ayden, Jeroen, Lisa, Boy, Jurre and Marrit.
        - Join social stuff, you know the drill
        
        **Make a plan/come up with ideas on how to improve HR operations in Q2.**
        
        - I'm really curious to find out where you would make changes once you get up to speed. This can be a one-pager with your 'assessment' and advice. This can be a joined effort of course :).
        
        Recruitment:
        
        - **Get up to speed with Recruitment**

Content: ### Where to start

We can basically hire anyone from anywhere in the world. But the migration and relocation procedure will be different for some countries. It's good to know that the migration procedure and relocation can take up to 8 weeks. So when interviewing a new candidate, that should be something to be aware of.  The information below should give you a good idea of what the differences are between different countries. 

As a lead, if you want to move forward with a candidate and make an offer, please contact HR for support first. In general the procedure looks like something like this:

1. There is a green light after the pair session;
2. Contact HR to discuss the salary, startdate and the relocation offer. In some cases HR needs to contact EMG in advance to check some legal stuff;
3. You have a ""yes"" from our candidate? HR can take over from here and will start the procedure with EMG;
4. HR will keep you up to date and help you with the on-boarding;
5. HR needs to be up to date about renewals or any other significant changes in salary or contract. These things have consequences for the work permit of our new colleague.

## Some important reminders

- It can take up to 8 weeks before a new hire can actually start working at Blendle.
- It's important to inform the candidates about the (lack of) housing in Utrecht, be realistic.
- We offer a relocation packages which can be customised within some boundries.

Content: **Who is involved**: hiring team and HR
    
    **Timing follow-up:** asap
    
    **Goal:** all-round assessment and selling
    
    **How:**
    
    Format pair day (example):
    
    Most important part is that the whole hiring team gets together to make a hiring decision. Could be the end of the day, could be the next day. Everybody should have a rating 1-3 on Work Drive and Fit  reasoning. 
    
    The meeting format: *on the count of three* show 1, 2 or 3 fingers for Work (your rating). Discuss the ratings. Do the same for Drive and Fit. 
    
    End with an *on the count of three:* show thumbs up or thumbs down on hiring. Hiring decisions should be conclusive. 
    
- **5. Reference check**
    
    **Who is responsible**: hiring manager/teamlead
    
    **Who is involved**: hiring manager/teamlead
    
    **Timing follow-up:** asap
    
    **Goal:** As hiring manager you want to ensure we are hiring the right candidate. And to understand under what circumstances a candidate thrives or doesn't.
    
    **How:**
    
    The hiring manager or the hiring team will contact references before proceeding. Ask for references at the end of the pair day. You should check them before making an offer. Try at least 2 references. Write a short report of the conversation in github or homerun.
    
    **Questions you can as a reference are for example:**
    
    - Can you describe your working relationship with this person?

Content: # Hiring

Getting new people to join Blendle is a **high effort, high impact** thing to do. The reward is huge, when you see the people you hired adding value to the company. Imagine not hiring that person: that new idea, design, piece of code, algorithm or audio show would not have been there. Your hire could be key to the succes of Blendle: that's a lot of impact. The other side of the same coin is that it's high effort too. These 4 pointers will help you get started. 

- **Personnel planning**
    
    Planning the number and type of people you need in the future is hard but also crucial. Hiring people takes time (~3 months), so looking ahead is important for making your projects succeed. Without the right (number of) people, it's hard to build a cool product.
    
    When making plans for **the coming and next quarter:**
    
    1. **Determine what work needs to be done, looking 6-12 months ahead, and decide if we have enough resources to do so.** 
        
        Our basic premise is that we work with the team we have and we hire reactively. But ask yourself a few questions. Do you have the right number and type of people? What kind of skills, expertise, experience do you need in what amount? What can we fix internally? What can we teach the people who are at Blendle? What can we just try with advice from outside? Is your ask temporary or permanent? How is the current workload? Can we afford to ship less quickly?

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy.

QUESTION: What is the purpose of the trial period in the first month?
=========
Content: # Your 1st month

Hey you! Welcome to Blendle. Buckle up, you're in for one hell of a ride :). 

The faster you get settled in the better, so we came up with a structure for your first month to make sure you have a smooth start.

- **Structure 1st month**
    
    Your first month is officially your trial period, which means both parties can terminate the contract if we figure out it is a total mismatch. In Blendle history, this happened once. Your first month is **not** an extended hiring process. As you might have noticed, the hiring process was pretty thorough and you made it through. This means we are pretty sure this is a good match. But, life happens so it's good to have a safeguard like the trial period, just don't feel any extra pressure plz.
    
    - **Before day 1:** your contract is signed and all the administrative stuff is taken care of. After that you got your on-boarding e-mail which probably led you here. This e-mail contains all the basic knowledge and acces codes to get you going.
    - **Day 1:** **Start** around 10:00 (depending on your team, check with them), receive your laptop and Blendle stuff, get settled in (where is the toilet, how does the coffee machine work). Your buddy will get you started in terms of work.

    - **Week 1:** Make sure to **sit down with your lead** in the first few days to get to know each other and talk about expectations [and goals for the 1st month](http://goals.blendle.io/) and the 1st quarter (see below for a structure). Make sure to schedule your week 2 and week 4 check-ins.
    - **Week 2: Have a check-in** regarding expectations and goals. If there are doubts (from both sides): this is the time to say it. If there are severe doubts, think about scheduling another check-in next week (week 3).
    - **Week 4: Have a check-in** regarding expectations and goals. Your trial period ends and you wrap up your first month together. It's important to come up with a few personal goals in this talk. Think about feedback you got and things you would like to achieve, learn or do at Blendle. After this, you will receive continuous feedback and will be involved in the feedback cycle like everyone. This is also a good moment to schedule your weekly or bi-weekly 1on1's with your lead.

FINAL ANSWER:","The purpose of the trial period in the first month is to allow both parties to terminate the contract if they determine it is a total mismatch. It is not an extended hiring process, but rather a safeguard in case the match is not as expected. During the trial period, the employee will have check-ins with their lead in the first and fourth weeks to discuss expectations and goals. Personal goals will be established, and feedback will be provided. The trial period ends after the fourth week, and continuous feedback and involvement in the feedback cycle will follow. Weekly or bi-weekly 1on1's with the lead will also be scheduled.

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.

Officer Rivera was 22.

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.

Content: # History

It's the **28th of April 2014**, the day Blendle was born. Marten and Alexander expected a few friends and partners to show up in an old warehouse in Amsterdam for their 'launch' party. 30 minutes before the start, the room filled with cameras and reporters. More then enough people were interested to see and hear what they came up with. Even PowNews sent a reporter:

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

A little rewind: in 2011, Marten found himself in a bookstore, a bit frustrated, looking at a magazine (as reenacted beautifully in this picture below). He was frustrated that he had to buy the whole magazine, whereas he only wanted to read one article from it. The first idea for Blendle was born and was called MyMagazine. He started talking to a lot of people in the media world, including Alexander. Alexander wasn't convinced yet.

In **mid-2012**, Marten asked Jort to make the first sketches and wireframes. 

**June 2012**, these are the first sketches of Blendle:

Alexander and Marten stay in touch and, after seeing the first sketches, Alexander sees the potential and decides to join. Together they have an 'office' in the staircase of the science centre Nemo in Amsterdam. With the prototypes and Alexander on board, the conversations with the publishers actually start to get interesting. Alexander and Marten take all the feedback and criticism from the publishers back to their 'office' and keep improving the product.

In **September 2013,** Blendle received ****100,000 euros from a fund for innovation in journalism.

**5 September 2013:** First announcement of Blendle in the Dutch TV show DWDD:

Content: # Blendle value's

Putting our set of values or our way of life in writing wasn't an easy task. Mainly because the moment we started putting this in writing, it already altered. We started with a set of Blendle peeps writing down every word that came to mind when thinking about Blendle. We made categories and tried making sentences out of it. We shared that with the whole group, got some good feedback and slimmed it down to 5 powerful value's.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

QUESTION: How should I travel to the office?
=========
Content: Walking Route from Utrecht CS can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTY6m0Pyul0):

Entrance code: [here](https://www.notion.so/8354943cbce846e086ad48e67dc153bc)

You can park your car [here](http://www.parkeren-utrecht.nl/parkeergarage-moreelsepark). Our Office Manager will get you a parking card asap (if you plan to come by car often). Until then, you can get a get-out-of-parking-stamp with her. Blendle will pay for it.

Or just come by train, we?ll get you a fancy NS business card.

When you enter on your first day, it?s probably best to team up with your teammate/buddy and sit next to or near him or her. Just know that you?re free to sit anywhere you like. Just know that further to the back (behind the meeting rooms) we like to keep things quiet. Just to keep focus :). To improve focus we have one rule called the headphone-rule. Headphones on means ""do not disturb"". Pretty straight-forward, but it works.

More practical information about our office and door lock can be found [**here](General%20&%20practical%20b2682126db8e47bf8e5fabb8b5b4c1ce.md)**

**Massage**

Every week on Wednesday from 12.30-16.00h (might change, see the all@ calendar), we have a masseuse come by to relieve us from stress (what stress), RSI, that aching back or tiredness. And yes its great! There is no queue, just a free-for-all.

Content: When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:
    
    - **It is impossible to work 60 hours productively over a longer period of time.** It hurts you and Blendle to work that much. If you are able to work 8 productive hours a day you should be proud of that. Sometimes it will be 6, sometimes 10: relax, it?s okay, You?re not working in a factory with time stamps.
    - Be flexible. Some days you just don?t have it. **You are not a machine.** Of course, first you?ll take a walk and grab a double espresso or a Club Mate, but if that doesn?t work it?s okay. Go home. Go to the gym. Go play with your kid. Go kiting. Go for a walk in the forest. Anything, just don?t sit behind your desk to ?make the hours?. That?s not helping anybody.
    - Working at home vs. at Blendle HQ. Try to strike a **balance between home/office**. Meetings and brainstorms are best done face to face but a day of deep work is best done in a cafe or on an abandoned island with 4g.
    - **Rotate, change your pace.** During the summer it can be nice to start at 6:30 and bike to the beach at 15.00h. During the winter, every morning might feel like a small hangover and you stroll into HQ at 10:00 after your first 2 cups of coffee.
- **Take care of your body and mind**
    
    
    **Take holidays and days off.**

Content: # Office

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?le is in charge of lunch ??sk her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

**Snacks and more**

Bring it up with someone you trust (HR, your team lead, Alexander, just anyone) and let?s try to fix it or at least talk about it.

Blendle cares. We care. So if you?re struggling, let?s change things to make sure you are happy, healthy and at your best.

# 3. Make changes: here are some quick wins

- **Look at your work life balance**
    
    
    > In engineering, people talk about asset integrity, which means that you service the machinery before it breaks. In modern organizations, the work is thinking and the machinery is your brain. We know from cognitive science that there are hard limits to what the brain can deal with. And yet, there?s an awful lot in the way we work which flies in the face of that. We think that if we work through the night, we?re being very clever. We?re not. We think we can work long hours ? month after month, year after year ? and that there won?t be any wear and tear.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: What are the guidelines for using company-owned equipment?
=========
Content: ---

**Snacks and more**

There will be beer, soda and snacks after All-hands presentations. 

On any other regular day:

- We might have chips etc, but op = op. We order snacks sometimes.
- This also goes for the cookies, fizzy drinks, beer or club mate.
- Fruit is something we want to provide everyday. If you notice we run out of fruit too fast and too often, ping our Office Manager so she can fix this.

If you are a big snack lover or don't want to be left empty-handed, consider bringing your own snacks.

---

**Clean up your shit**

You need to clean up your own shit. Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don't forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine. This 'system' works really well and keeps us away from bullshit like dishwasher duty.

Fahima is here every day, twice a day to clean this place, including toilets. 

---

**Think about the environment.**

Kill the lights. Turn down the heating. Don't waste paper #deadtrees. We separate our garbage into paper, glass, plastics and rest. Don't waste food: feel free to take home bread on Friday.

Content: People team uses this system to save and track all your personal documents and information as well. Whenever something changes, this will go through this system. You can change your contact information and address if you move. You can also always access this system to have a look at your documents, eg contract, reviews etc.

You can also send in your requests for reimbursement of business expenses and holidays.   

**Security**

We care about security. So, whenever possible (Google apps, GitHub etc): use two-factor authentication! And please turn on Full Disk Encryption (FileVault on Mac) on your computer. And of course, whether you're at the office or somewhere else,?e sure to lock your computer whenever you are AFK. And whenever you hear ?Brace, Brace!?, be sure to get yourself into brace-position. It is for your own and our safety. :-)

For sharing secure stuff with each other we use [Tresorit](https://tresorit.com/). Be sure to download that! If you need it, your team will also mention this, so don?t worry! Oh, and in case you?re wondering: we don?t share any user information via Slack or Google.

**1Password**

You should use a password manager to manage your secrets (e.g. passwords for your personal accounts or credit card details). This allows you to use *unique* passwords for your different accounts.

You can sign up for 1Password for Teams [here](https://www.notion.so/4bb2545b52664e7687a408c1e3262939) (not public).

Content: - You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.
    - This is a guideline.  If you have other national holidays you observe (eg Eid al-Fitr Suikerfeest, ending of Ramadan) feel free to work or be off when you want.
    
    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.
    - You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.
    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.
- **Backdrop**
    
    The law and additional ruling tell us what we can and can not do according to time off. We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:

Content: # Personal User Guide

We recently stumbled upon a [Firstround Review blog](http://firstround.com/review/the-indispensable-document-for-the-modern-manager/) about writing a manual for others about yourself. **In short: we advise our leaders at Blendle to write a User Guide for their team members.** The guide is a living and breathing document which gives really concrete pointers on how to work with you. It also gives more context and information about you, so people understand why you do things or act a certain way.

Answering these questions is a quick way to do it. Below are more advanced examples.

Oh, made a guide? Share it with other leads!

    2. Go to edit:

    3. Adjust the job description to your liking:
        - The first section is about the team, what they do and the reason why we are hiring.
        - The second section consists of the 4-5 reasons we chose to work at Blendle. You can alter them, but you can keep those the same.
        - The third section is our wishlist: alter these to get the most important stuff from your intake (above) across.

            The section 'Questions' is most important for now. Make sure to come up with a few good job-related questions based on your intake. For example for Android dev: 'Tell us about the app you have in the store :)'. Be creative: a good question tells you a lot more than a well-designed resume.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known.

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.

QUESTION: What is the policy on using personal devices for work?
=========
Content: People team uses this system to save and track all your personal documents and information as well. Whenever something changes, this will go through this system. You can change your contact information and address if you move. You can also always access this system to have a look at your documents, eg contract, reviews etc.

You can also send in your requests for reimbursement of business expenses and holidays.   

**Security**

We care about security. So, whenever possible (Google apps, GitHub etc): use two-factor authentication! And please turn on Full Disk Encryption (FileVault on Mac) on your computer. And of course, whether you're at the office or somewhere else,?e sure to lock your computer whenever you are AFK. And whenever you hear ?Brace, Brace!?, be sure to get yourself into brace-position. It is for your own and our safety. :-)

For sharing secure stuff with each other we use [Tresorit](https://tresorit.com/). Be sure to download that! If you need it, your team will also mention this, so don?t worry! Oh, and in case you?re wondering: we don?t share any user information via Slack or Google.

**1Password**

You should use a password manager to manage your secrets (e.g. passwords for your personal accounts or credit card details). This allows you to use *unique* passwords for your different accounts.

You can sign up for 1Password for Teams [here](https://www.notion.so/4bb2545b52664e7687a408c1e3262939) (not public).

Content: # Office

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?le is in charge of lunch ??sk her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

QUESTION: How can I request a reference letter?
=========
Content: **Questions you can as a reference are for example:**
    
    - Can you describe your working relationship with this person?
    - What is he/she like to work with?
    - What can he/she improve upon?
    - What advice would you give his/her next hiring manager?
    - Would you rehire this person?
    
    Here is [a nice guideline](https://bothsidesofthetable.com/how-to-make-better-reference-calls-d493a12714f0) on reference check.
    
    You can also use questions that might have arisen after the pair day. You should NOT ask any questions about the person's race, gender, sexual preference, disabilities or health, political affiliations, religion, or family (children). All reference check feedback should be entered into github or homerun.
    
- ***Optional: extra step***
    
    When there are doubts, it's usually a no hire. When the doubts are not based on solid findings, you could consider taking an extra step. 
    
    - Doubt on fit: consider having a beer/ice tea with someone on a different location.
    - Doubt on work: consider sharing your thoughts with the candidate and ask how/she could convince you. Could be another interview with a senior person within Blendle or another assignment.
    - Doubt on drive: this is probably a no.

    3. Adjust the job description to your liking:
        - The first section is about the team, what they do and the reason why we are hiring.
        - The second section consists of the 4-5 reasons we chose to work at Blendle. You can alter them, but you can keep those the same.
        - The third section is our wishlist: alter these to get the most important stuff from your intake (above) across.
        - The last step is altering the Application form (click 'Application form' next to 'Job post').

            The section 'Questions' is most important for now. Make sure to come up with a few good job-related questions based on your intake.

QUESTION: Who has ownership of the quarterly coaching feedback process at Blendle?
=========
Content: # Our Feedback Process

> At Blendle we value the **Freedom** and **Responsibility** of giving **Proactive** and **Honest** feedback to drive excellent **Team Work**.   We try to build input points into everything we do.  We even got feedback on upgrading our Feedback process - all of which is incorporated into the new process below.
> 

# **Typical Feedback Moments @ Blendle:**

- **Sprint retro** - every 2 weeks.  How did the cycle go?  What did we learn? How did we feel?
- **Agile Process retro** - Monthly.  How can we improve the process and collaboration?
- **BIG HR People Surve**y - two times a year Q1 and Q4 on Employee experience.
- **EVERYDAY!**

# The **Quarterly Coaching Feedback Process**

At least every Quarter we want to make sure you get a formal feedback and coaching conversation focused on your personal and professional development, and progress.  And luckily, the quarterly process aligns to the timing of our Objectives Goals Strategies Measures, so you can chat about both with your manager at the same time.

### The Process:

**YOU** run ***your*** process - End to End.  By having full ownership you control your development (that ****responsible** value again ?) and focus on **teamwork** **and ****honesty ****by discussing feedback together (rather than through your manager).  So you're developing from the development process itself!

Content: Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :). 
    

## Here's what you can do:

1. Actively **think** about the possibility that someone's time at Blendle is up. At least every month for everyone in your team.
2. **Flag** this at HR/MT when that happens. 
3. **Ask** for help if needed already at this stage.
4. **Analyse** (maybe together) the problem and give feedback to the person in question: try to get on the same page about where things go 'wrong'. These are pointers which might steer your thoughts. Real situations are always more complex. 
    - Someone is **underperforming**. Try using [the Matrix?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=0) to track down the areas where you think things should improve. Give actionable feedback and try to come up with concrete points to work on in his/her personal goals. Don't wait for the feedback cycle, the time is always now.
    - Someone **stopped growing or learning**. This isn't necessarily an immediate problem, but it can be because most people like working at Blendle because they grow and learn so much. Someone standing still for a year is a red flag.

- Don?t save all your feedback up - give at the time of the event (or shortly after) -  There should be no surprises
- Don't make it personal.  Focus on the situation not the person. and how you can work together to improve it for next time.
- Examples are fine, but don't use them for the blame game.
- Reflect on your intention in giving someone your feedback. Are you giving it to help someone or to shame someone?  Did you have a role in the situation that happened?
- Be clear and direct, subtle gibberish doesn't help anyone.
- Remember A-P-P-R-E-C-I-A-T-I-O-N helps motivate and shows people their unique value.

<aside>
? Tips for r**eceiving feedback**

</aside>

- Always assume feedback is given to help you
- Be open to listening and don't get stuck in a spiral of defending or pointing fingers back.
Take responsibility if something went wrong and focus on learning how to work together better.
- Be curious - Why is this feedback given to you? What is really at the root of it?  Is it the feedback itself that indicates a problem or is some emotion underlying it that needs to be addressed?

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.

QUESTION: How can I request a transfer to a different department or location?
=========
Content: ### Where to start

We can basically hire anyone from anywhere in the world. But the migration and relocation procedure will be different for some countries. It's good to know that the migration procedure and relocation can take up to 8 weeks. So when interviewing a new candidate, that should be something to be aware of.  The information below should give you a good idea of what the differences are between different countries. 

As a lead, if you want to move forward with a candidate and make an offer, please contact HR for support first. In general the procedure looks like something like this:

1. There is a green light after the pair session;
2. Contact HR to discuss the salary, startdate and the relocation offer. In some cases HR needs to contact EMG in advance to check some legal stuff;
3. You have a ""yes"" from our candidate? HR can take over from here and will start the procedure with EMG;
4. HR will keep you up to date and help you with the on-boarding;
5. HR needs to be up to date about renewals or any other significant changes in salary or contract. These things have consequences for the work permit of our new colleague.

## Some important reminders

- It can take up to 8 weeks before a new hire can actually start working at Blendle.
- It's important to inform the candidates about the (lack of) housing in Utrecht, be realistic.

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined.

QUESTION: What are the grounds for termination at the company?
=========
Content: ## **What you can expect from HR**

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.

Content: # General disciplinary measures

Our Social code is crystal clear and very easily to follow. However, we also want to be clear about the consequences if for any reason you fail to follow the rules:

- **Verbal warning.** When we find it necessary to formally give you a warning. It might be a minor violation or your first time.
- **Official written warning**.  You will receive an official written warning for any serious breach of Blendle?s social code. This also applies when you already have had a maximum of two verbal warnings and your behavior hasn't improved. After 1 official written warning, we will move on to more serious measures like suspension or termination.
- **Suspension.** This happens when you have committed a very serious offense, or when we need time to investigate a case. Your access to Blendle will be temporarily revoked until it's clear whether and which measures should be taken.
- **Termination.** When the violation is of a very serious nature. These violations are most of the time determined by law and because of the severity of the act, we can terminate your contract immediately. Or, after an official written warning.

## When do we apply these measures

When we apply a measure, which measure we apply, and how long we apply it always depends on the situation and severity of the violation.

- Any form of harassment including bullying, intimidation, malicious gossip and victimisation of your colleagues, either inside or outside of the office.
Source: Notion_DB\Blendle's Employee Handbook a834d55573614857a48a9ce9ec4194e3\Blendle Social Code 1178dd7f18cf49cea04bf9efcb2d84b2\General disciplinary measures f8396878804a4eab9277ba5d2cd4cd08.md

Content: Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behavior is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn?t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions.

If you suspect that someone doesn?t realize their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when:

- Your lead, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.

Salarisbalie is our payroll specialist and makes sure we get paid correctly every month, Salarisbalie works within a tool called NMBRS. NMBRS is used for saving and monitoring all personnel files,  personal information, holidays, dossiers, contracts, etc. 

When you start at Blendle, you get onboarded in this system. Easy peasy, everything in one place. 

You, HR and your lead have access to this self service tool.

So what can you do with Nmbrs?   Next to accessing your personal information and contracts, you can also change your contact information yourself. Plus, requesting time off and claiming expenses just became a whole lot easier: 

- **Time off request**
    
    **Why are we doing this if we have unlimited holidays?**
    The ""unlimited fair use"" rule stays. We are adding the balance for legal reasons. 
    
    And while we don't have a maximum, we do have a **minimum** that we want you to take, to keep you healthy - 20 days each year, for a 40 hour contract. 
    
    Plus, NMBRS has a super easy way to overview who is out of office and when, Blendle wide.  A great tool for teams and managers to plan work and availability especially around big projects or releases.
    
    **It looks weird in the system.....I see a negative balance!**

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.

If you are pregnant with twins or more... you can leave between 10-8 weeks before your due date. Please let us know if you encounter unexpected complications during this time. We understand it's not always easy and will do our best to accommodate your situation.
        
        There are a couple more exceptions that can affect your maternity leave. You can either contact HR for more info or [visit the government?s info page.](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/zwangerschapsverlof-en-bevallingsverlof/vraag-en-antwoord/hoe-lang-duurt-zwangerschapsverlof-en-bevallingsverlof)

        - Show your pregnancy statement to HR

    Please let your lead and HR know if you are planning to take parental leave. HR can help you with all your questions.

Content: 3. Within 4 weeks after birth:
        - Inform HR of the birth date
        - Let your lead and HR know if you need anything when you are back at work
    
- **Birth leave**
    
    As a partner (if you are not the one giving birth) you are also entitled to leave after the birth of your child. The official term for this is birth leave. By law you can take 6 week off to enjoy your new offspring and help your partner (within the first 6 months after birth). During these 6 **weeks** you get your full salary paid. Just make sure you and your lead have made arrangements about the continuity of the ongoing projects/work within your team during your absence. And inform the hr@blendle.com of the dates for UWV and legal reasons. 
    
    Again, please let us know if you and your partner encounter unexpected complications. We?ll do our best to help where we can.
    
- **Parental leave**
    
    As a parent (both parents) you are also entitled to parental leave for every child. In total, you can have **26 x your weekly work hours** off per child. If you work 40 hours a week, it would be 1040 hours total parental leave for each child.  So this right applies to each child separately and you can make use of it until a child is 8 years old. You can choose to take time off either for a longer period at once, or spread it. For example 1 day per week off.

Content: # Learning Budget

There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely.  Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? 

Does Blendle benefit from the fact that you are spending time and money on learning and development? 

Does this fit in your personal development path at Blendle? 

Does it match personal goals? 

Does it match the role and responsibilities?

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how. Does this fit in someones personal development path at Blendle? Does it match the personal goals? Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

A good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own. The rest is common sense.

As leads you can decide to say Yes or No to budget requests based on the above questions. If you need help deciding, you can discuss with HR.

**?0-?250** = no study contract. Like a cool book, online course or a ticket to a summit.

**?250-1500 =** 12 months study contract. Like a full blown study/course or a conference (abroad).

**?1500** = edge case with 24 months study contract, please discuss with HR.

- We arrange and pay for the first month of temporary accommodation.
- We assist with permanent housing. Like helping with the search, negotiations and settling in.
- We assist with the 30% ruling tax application.

What we offer is flexible and can be adjusted to certain personal needs. But we highly recommend to stick with this all-in-one package to reduce any hassle and stress when relocating to the Netherlands.

Content: # Hiring

Getting new people to join Blendle is a **high effort, high impact** thing to do. The reward is huge, when you see the people you hired adding value to the company. Imagine not hiring that person: that new idea, design, piece of code, algorithm or audio show would not have been there. Your hire could be key to the succes of Blendle: that's a lot of impact. The other side of the same coin is that it's high effort too. These 4 pointers will help you get started. 

- **Personnel planning**
    
    Planning the number and type of people you need in the future is hard but also crucial. Hiring people takes time (~3 months), so looking ahead is important for making your projects succeed. Without the right (number of) people, it's hard to build a cool product.
    
    When making plans for **the coming and next quarter:**
    
    1. **Determine what work needs to be done, looking 6-12 months ahead, and decide if we have enough resources to do so.** 
        
        Our basic premise is that we work with the team we have and we hire reactively. But ask yourself a few questions. Do you have the right number and type of people? What kind of skills, expertise, experience do you need in what amount? What can we fix internally? What can we teach the people who are at Blendle? What can we just try with advice from outside? Is your ask temporary or permanent? How is the current workload? Can we afford to ship less quickly?

Content: ### Where to start

We can basically hire anyone from anywhere in the world. But the migration and relocation procedure will be different for some countries. It's good to know that the migration procedure and relocation can take up to 8 weeks. So when interviewing a new candidate, that should be something to be aware of.  The information below should give you a good idea of what the differences are between different countries. 

As a lead, if you want to move forward with a candidate and make an offer, please contact HR for support first. In general the procedure looks like something like this:

1. There is a green light after the pair session;
2. Contact HR to discuss the salary, startdate and the relocation offer. In some cases HR needs to contact EMG in advance to check some legal stuff;
3. You have a ""yes"" from our candidate? HR can take over from here and will start the procedure with EMG;
4. HR will keep you up to date and help you with the on-boarding;
5. HR needs to be up to date about renewals or any other significant changes in salary or contract. These things have consequences for the work permit of our new colleague.

## Some important reminders

- It can take up to 8 weeks before a new hire can actually start working at Blendle.
- It's important to inform the candidates about the (lack of) housing in Utrecht, be realistic.
- We offer a relocation packages which can be customised within some boundries.

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined.

Content: - **Off cycle salary increases**
    
    **Contract renewal** is not a moment that automatically means it is time to talk about money. We are not a company of people who demand *""give me X or I walk''*.  
    
    People can bring up salary any moment they want and we take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high) - see ""**How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?""**
    
    **Good reasons to raise offcycle**
    
    - Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.
    - Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone's impact and capabilities. It's important to be able to quantify that curve.
    - New information internally or externally.
    - New information by benchmarking studies or during hiring.
    
    **Not so good reasons to give a raise**
    
    - Colleague got another offer and uses this to get a raise.
    - 'I earn X for this company, that's a lot of money, I want a piece of the pie'.
    - Colleague just wants an incentive to stay. Money is never the answer, because it will fade - very - fast.
- **Control questions**
    
    Now before you finally decide
    
    - If we had to hire someone today for X's job, what would we pay them?
    - What would it cost Blendle as a business to find a new person (hard to replace, scarcity, time to hire, impact on day to day business & product)?

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","The company offers a referral bonus to team members who help find and hire new employees. The referral bonus is offered once the new team member is hired and has been with Blendle for 1 month. The amount of the bonus depends on the position being filled, with a standard bonus of ?250 net for full-time employment or pro rata for any position, and a bonus of ?1000 net for full-time employment or pro rata for difficult-to-fill roles. Any employee at Blendle can refer a candidate for any open position by introducing the candidate to People Operations or Recruitment either through a full application or a sourcing lead. The hiring managers, board, People Operations, and Recruitment are not eligible for bonuses when hiring for their teams. The company also allows for off-cycle salary increases based on factors such as drastic changes in role and responsibilities, steep learning curves, new information internally or externally, and benchmarking studies or hiring. However, there are certain reasons that are not considered good reasons to give a raise, such as a colleague getting another offer or wanting an incentive to stay. The company encourages employees to bring up salary concerns at any time and takes them seriously. Control questions are used to help determine appropriate salary adjustments.

Content: - Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

Content: Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :). 
    

## Here's what you can do:

1. Actively **think** about the possibility that someone's time at Blendle is up. At least every month for everyone in your team.
2. **Flag** this at HR/MT when that happens. 
3. **Ask** for help if needed already at this stage.
4. **Analyse** (maybe together) the problem and give feedback to the person in question: try to get on the same page about where things go 'wrong'. These are pointers which might steer your thoughts. Real situations are always more complex. 
    - Someone is **underperforming**. Try using [the Matrix?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=0) to track down the areas where you think things should improve. Give actionable feedback and try to come up with concrete points to work on in his/her personal goals. Don't wait for the feedback cycle, the time is always now.
    - Someone **stopped growing or learning**. This isn't necessarily an immediate problem, but it can be because most people like working at Blendle because they grow and learn so much. Someone standing still for a year is a red flag.

Content: ## **What you can expect from HR**

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","A team lead should flag the possibility of someone leaving to HR/MT when they believe in a different direction for the company or the team, when time is up and it's healthy to move on, when attempts to fix the situation have been unsuccessful, or when the situation is not progressing and it's best to part ways. They should actively think about this possibility every month for everyone in their team and flag it to HR/MT when it arises. HR will then provide support and guidance in handling the situation.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: Why does Blendle believe that a diverse team is crucial to its success and product?
=========
Content: # Diversity and Inclusion

It was this ^^ picture from our Christmas party three years ago which got us some replies on Twitter. A lot of males and a lot of white. We know that we need to do better to make Blendle a more diverse workplace. We spend a lot of time thinking about diversity and inclusion. After reading, talking and listening, we learned a few things:

- This is a sensitive topic: feelings and opinions are involved.
- This is a trending topic: there is a lot of noise and it's hard to pin down the essence.
- This is not a new, but renewed topic.
- Diversity and inclusion is more of a scale than a simple yes or no statement.
- Everyone is biased and every company is at risk of becoming less diverse and inclusive.
- A more diverse and inclusive company **>** a less diverse and inclusive company for a lot of reasons.
- Diversity and inclusion is not 'just' about gender or race, so looking at just those numbers can limit your thoughts on this topic. The practical side of this topic is also way more subtle.

**Diversity and inclusion at Blendle**

What we know now:

- We believe in the importance of a **diverse** team because we believe **it's crucial to our succes and product.** We try to add meaning to peoples everyday life by helping them reach quality content instead of cat gifs on Facebook. This can only be done by a group of people with different backgrounds, expertise, personalities, talents, ideas and opinions.

Content: - We believe being **inclusive** is important because it **fits our core values** of wanting to be a great place to work and really caring for each other. A place where people feel welcome and can be themselves. Inclusivity is crucial to our work environment and culture.
- We have trouble hiring diverse profiles. We noticed no flaws in the hiring process which would lead to favour a certain type of profile. We did notice that the 'pools' in which we are hiring (journalism and tech) are dominated by a certain profile which could explain this trend.
- We have open-minded people at Blendle who are willing and are becoming more aware.

**Some observations**:

- We tend to speak in Dutch in social settings. It can easily make non-Dutch people uncomfortable. We should speak English.
- The way we work (especially in meetings) suits extravert people better then introvert people.
- There is not a lot of variation on standard diversity variables like political views, religion, age, ethnicity, gender and educational background. Again, partly explained by the field we're in.
- Most of the leaders at Blendle are male.
- There is equal pay between men and women in the same role.
- We believe aiming for diversity numbers narrows the conversation on the topic for now. We decided to use the data to feed the conversation but not implement quotas.

**What we do:**

Content: # What can Blendle do?

There?s a lot Blendle could improve and we?re working on that. The fact that we are a fast-paced startup with an aim to save journalism is not something that will change any time soon. This also means that we are facing a runway, which affects our everyday work. This is fuelling us to go the extra mile, but the downsides are also obvious.

So what can Blendle do?

- **Voicing vision & mission more:** everybody should feel connected to where Blendle is going and why. Talking about this more will help everybody align. This way everybody has more influence on the direction and it is more clear why a change of direction is made and how this affects your work.
- Open channels: **work on transparency and trust**: everybody should be able to speak up if they feel that the stress level is too high. Also when someone feels like they aren?t in the right role or simply doing work they don?t love everyday.
- **Build an environment which is less stressful.** This piece is step 1 on this point. Notice when people work too much. Tell people if we notice it and tell them to take action (go home, take holiday, work less, talk to someone). Let?s also keep improving the process we have in place for when people feel it?s too much.

Content: - Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.

Content: # General disciplinary measures

Our Social code is crystal clear and very easily to follow. However, we also want to be clear about the consequences if for any reason you fail to follow the rules:

- **Verbal warning.** When we find it necessary to formally give you a warning. It might be a minor violation or your first time.
- **Official written warning**.  You will receive an official written warning for any serious breach of Blendle?s social code. This also applies when you already have had a maximum of two verbal warnings and your behavior hasn't improved. After 1 official written warning, we will move on to more serious measures like suspension or termination.
- **Suspension.** This happens when you have committed a very serious offense, or when we need time to investigate a case. Your access to Blendle will be temporarily revoked until it's clear whether and which measures should be taken.
- **Termination.** When the violation is of a very serious nature. These violations are most of the time determined by law and because of the severity of the act, we can terminate your contract immediately. Or, after an official written warning.

## When do we apply these measures

When we apply a measure, which measure we apply, and how long we apply it always depends on the situation and severity of the violation.

- Any form of harassment including bullying, intimidation, malicious gossip and victimisation of your colleagues, either inside or outside of the office.

SOURCES:

QUESTION: What happens to my unused vacation or paid time off when I resign?
=========
Content: 'Time off' can be divided into two buckets:
    
    1. **Holidays and national holidays**:
        
        Your contract states you have 4 weeks of paid time off per year, by law.
        
        On average we have 8 national holidays per year. We have no CAO (collective employment agreement), which means you are not entitled to paid time off on every national holiday. We decided to follow the most common situation in an average company, which in practice means most people are off on the big national holidays. But that's your own choice, it's not a right or an obligation, so feel free to improvise. Some teams even have to (editorial and support, for example).
        
        These rules state that we are off on 'Bevrijdingsdag' once every 5 years. But we aren't allowed time off on Eid al-Fitr (Suikerfeest, ending of the Ramadan). That makes no sense to us. 
        
        So here is how we approach holidays and national holidays in practice.
        
        You 'have' 5 weeks holiday and ~8 national holidays per year. We want you to use this time off to reload but you decide when and how to consume this. You must also feel free to improvise. You work hard, maybe even a bit too hard, so you might need some extra time off to stay happy and healthy. This also works the other way around: maybe you had a chill quarter and feel no need to take a holiday: feel free to do so. We want you to think about what your body and mind needs instead of your quota.

Your team members will sometimes not be present ?. No worries, they are just taking time off or recovering. Here's what you can do. 

**Holidays: time off ??**

If you haven't please take a look at the section about time off for everyone: 

[Taking Time off x](Taking%20Time%20off%20x%2000c8b7bcab1a4b1ba5d285adb774b32d.md)

- Your team will put a request in for time off through Nmbrs. Nmbrs will inform you through email, you can accept or decline this request by clicking the link in the email.

- We only track this to have a handy overview of who is off and when, for example for planning around projects and releases.
- Keep in mind we don't pay out holidays at the end of the ride.
- Make sure people take enough time off (4-6 weeks per year) by bringing it up every once in a while. But: **it's their responsibility.**
- Make sure people **communicate** their time off well with the team and you. You have a say in this and you have to agree on someones time off (which will be fine in 99% of cases).
- Make sure your people put it in the **@all and their own agenda.**
- When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.

Content: **It looks weird in the system.....I see a negative balance!**
    
    For everyone with a 40 hours contract, the **minimum balance is set as 20 days** in NMBRS each year, and this re-sets at the start of each year.  In the case that you didn't take all 20 days by end of December (we hope this is not the case as you should take the advised minimum, at a minimum), these days will show in your balance for the next year for 6 months.
    
    (note: as we are introducing the tool in June 2020, the remaining balance is 10 for 2020, that's half of the normal balance)
    
    On the other hand, if **you exceed this minimum balance** you will show as negative in the system.  Nothing to worry about **-** remember... **we don't track your holidays in that kind of way**.  As long as your manager has agreed to your holidays and you have added your request, it's fine to go negative.

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","Unused vacation or paid time off is not paid out at the end of employment at Blendle. It is the employee's responsibility to take enough time off (4-6 weeks per year) and communicate their time off with the team. In certain situations, such as a funeral, moving, child-related matters, or dental appointments, the specific needs of the employee can be agreed upon. If an employee exceeds the minimum balance of 20 days, they may show a negative balance in the system, but this is not a cause for concern as Blendle does not track holidays in that way. The process for submitting holiday plans is through the NMBRS system, where the employee can fill in the dates and reason for the time off and the request will be approved by their lead.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life.

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror.

Content: ## **The conversation**

Try initiating an open conversation by scheduling a meet on the first day of return to work, or at least as soon as you can. The purpose behind this conversation is not to judge someone for being absent. But it's meant to uncover the factors behind, or the cause of the absence. There is a good chance that you or Blendle can prevent the next absence by talking about this.

**Explain why you are having this conversation**

- Don't ask right away about the problems and sickness. Make clear that it's about being absent.
- Share a list of dates and patterns relevant to being absent.
- Talk about how the absence worries you, how it effects the team and anyone close to the team member.

**How to and what questions to ask:**

[Google Slides - create and edit presentations online, for free.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11TAG83sZkoXBBGi8pIOVTnYq0fyR5SkzuQUDZN4bQUk/edit#slide=id.p17)

**Notes**

- Always ask open questions.
- Know your facts, this will prevent unnecessary discussions. You can ask HR for the statics.
- Let your team member steer you towards the right solutions, don't fill in the blanks.
- Take notes, set goals and share them with each other afterwards.
- Monitor the progress, have recurring conversations about the situation and the goals.
- There is a fine barrier between being too pushy and being truly engaged and it's normal to feel that dilemma. Just use your own judgement.

FINAL ANSWER:","To request a leave of absence, you should reach out to HR. They will provide guidance and advice, especially for longer leaves of absence. It is recommended to initiate an open conversation with HR to discuss the reasons for the absence and any necessary arrangements.

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people.

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.

Officer Rivera was 22.

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.

Content: ## **The conversation**

Try initiating an open conversation by scheduling a meet on the first day of return to work, or at least as soon as you can. The purpose behind this conversation is not to judge someone for being absent. But it's meant to uncover the factors behind, or the cause of the absence. There is a good chance that you or Blendle can prevent the next absence by talking about this.

**Explain why you are having this conversation**

- Don't ask right away about the problems and sickness. Make clear that it's about being absent.
- Share a list of dates and patterns relevant to being absent.
- Talk about how the absence worries you, how it effects the team and anyone close to the team member.

**How to and what questions to ask:**

[Google Slides - create and edit presentations online, for free.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11TAG83sZkoXBBGi8pIOVTnYq0fyR5SkzuQUDZN4bQUk/edit#slide=id.p17)

**Notes**

- Always ask open questions.
- Know your facts, this will prevent unnecessary discussions. You can ask HR for the statics.
- Let your team member steer you towards the right solutions, don't fill in the blanks.
- Take notes, set goals and share them with each other afterwards.
- Monitor the progress, have recurring conversations about the situation and the goals.
- There is a fine barrier between being too pushy and being truly engaged and it's normal to feel that dilemma. Just use your own judgement.

Content: # Calling in sick/better

1. You are ill/sick or had an accident and **can not work.**
2. **Let your team and your lead know** that your are sick and when you expect to feel better. If your lead isn't in or on holidays, you can contact HR.
3. **Update everyone** on how you are feeling if it takes longer then expected. Stay home until you are better.
4. **Let everyone know** when you are back.

FYI:

- **Your lead calls you in sick with the [Arbo](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8),** which is important for insurance and legal purposes.

- If you call in sick more then 3 times in a year, that is considered above average, so Arbo advises us to check in with you if you are alright. We will.
- Don't feel guilty for being sick.
- Go to the doctor in time if you need to. Don't act tough.
- If you have weird or vague complaints over a longer period of time like headaches, bad sleep or panic-related stuff. Check your stress level.
- **You want to call or e-mail our direct contact at Arbo directly, you can find the contact details [right here](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8)** (not public)

=========
Content: # Learning Budget

There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely.  Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? 

Does Blendle benefit from the fact that you are spending time and money on learning and development? 

Does this fit in your personal development path at Blendle? 

Does it match personal goals? 

Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

Would you spend the money on this if it was your own?

Content: 2. **Keep teams small.** More then 4-6 people creates more overhead (mainly communication like e-mail/slack and interactions in general) and doesn't necessarily mean that the team performs better.

    3. **Keep budget in mind.** You should focus on getting the best team for the work you need done, but budget does play a role in this. People are our most important and most expensive resource. Hiring, therefore, is an expensive solution to a problem. 
    4. **Plan.** Discuss this step with your lead and HR.
        
        To be able to plan you need these variables: Team, Role, Profile and role description, Hitlist, Priority, Scarceness (1-5), Years of relevant experience, Salary range, Planning. 
        
         Here's an example of a template we've used in the past to plan our hiring Blendle-wide:

Content: ## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how. Does this fit in someones personal development path at Blendle? Does it match the personal goals? Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

A good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own. The rest is common sense.

As leads you can decide to say Yes or No to budget requests based on the above questions. If you need help deciding, you can discuss with HR.

**?0-?250** = no study contract. Like a cool book, online course or a ticket to a summit.

**?250-1500 =** 12 months study contract. Like a full blown study/course or a conference (abroad).

**?1500** = edge case with 24 months study contract, please discuss with HR.

        It's fair to say that it's harder to fill some positions compared to some other roles. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.
        
    - **Role and responsibilities.**
        
        Certain roles and people make more impact than others. This is reflected in pay.
        
    - **Actual impact and contribution**
        
        Since we don't really like job titles, it's good to look at someone's actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? Can we try to put that in numbers or concrete projects?
        
    - **Someone's starting point**
        
        If we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.
        
    
    *Note: all of this is not an exact science and is determined together, so please: ask for help.*
    
- **When do we talk about money?**
    - **Yearly company wide salary raises in January**
        
        Every year (in January) we take a good look at all the salaries at Cafeyn- Blendle. Right after the feedback cycle (which we use as input) we have salary talks with everyone. We chose to do this once a year so we don't have a constant conversation about money through the year.
        
- **Off cycle salary increases**

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","Budget plays a role in the hiring process. It is mentioned that budget should be kept in mind when hiring, as hiring is an expensive solution to a problem. The cost of hiring is considered in relation to the team's needs and the available budget. The decision to approve budget requests for learning and development or study contracts is made by the lead and finance or HR. The specific budget ranges for study contracts are also mentioned. Additionally, factors such as scarcity and market value, role and responsibilities, actual impact and contribution, and someone's starting point are taken into account when determining salary. Salary raises are discussed on a yearly basis in January, and off-cycle salary increases may also occur.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Content: ? **Tips for giving useful feedback**

</aside>

- Don?t save all your feedback up - give at the time of the event (or shortly after) -  There should be no surprises
- Don't make it personal.  Focus on the situation not the person. and how you can work together to improve it for next time.
- Examples are fine, but don't use them for the blame game.
- Reflect on your intention in giving someone your feedback. Are you giving it to help someone or to shame someone?  Did you have a role in the situation that happened?
- Be clear and direct, subtle gibberish doesn't help anyone.
- Remember A-P-P-R-E-C-I-A-T-I-O-N helps motivate and shows people their unique value.

<aside>
? Tips for r**eceiving feedback**

</aside>

- Always assume feedback is given to help you
- Be open to listening and don't get stuck in a spiral of defending or pointing fingers back.
Take responsibility if something went wrong and focus on learning how to work together better.
- Be curious - Why is this feedback given to you? What is really at the root of it?  Is it the feedback itself that indicates a problem or is some emotion underlying it that needs to be addressed?

Content: - **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?
    
    Are you giving praise?
    
    Are you actively challenging your team?
    
    Are you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?
    
    Are you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?
    
    Is your schedule (and that of your team) in a healthy rhythm (work-life balance)? You set the example.
    
    Is your team taking regular holidays/long weekends?
    
    Here?s an article about how to help your team with this:

Content: Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :). 
    

## Here's what you can do:

1. Actively **think** about the possibility that someone's time at Blendle is up. At least every month for everyone in your team.
2. **Flag** this at HR/MT when that happens. 
3. **Ask** for help if needed already at this stage.
4. **Analyse** (maybe together) the problem and give feedback to the person in question: try to get on the same page about where things go 'wrong'. These are pointers which might steer your thoughts. Real situations are always more complex. 
    - Someone is **underperforming**. Try using [the Matrix?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=0) to track down the areas where you think things should improve. Give actionable feedback and try to come up with concrete points to work on in his/her personal goals. Don't wait for the feedback cycle, the time is always now.
    - Someone **stopped growing or learning**. This isn't necessarily an immediate problem, but it can be because most people like working at Blendle because they grow and learn so much. Someone standing still for a year is a red flag.

Content: # Our Feedback Process

> At Blendle we value the **Freedom** and **Responsibility** of giving **Proactive** and **Honest** feedback to drive excellent **Team Work**.   We try to build input points into everything we do.  We even got feedback on upgrading our Feedback process - all of which is incorporated into the new process below.
> 

# **Typical Feedback Moments @ Blendle:**

- **Sprint retro** - every 2 weeks.  How did the cycle go?  What did we learn? How did we feel?
- **Agile Process retro** - Monthly.  How can we improve the process and collaboration?
- **BIG HR People Surve**y - two times a year Q1 and Q4 on Employee experience.
- **EVERYDAY!**

# The **Quarterly Coaching Feedback Process**

At least every Quarter we want to make sure you get a formal feedback and coaching conversation focused on your personal and professional development, and progress.  And luckily, the quarterly process aligns to the timing of our Objectives Goals Strategies Measures, so you can chat about both with your manager at the same time.

### The Process:

**YOU** run ***your*** process - End to End.  By having full ownership you control your development (that ****responsible** value again ?) and focus on **teamwork** **and ****honesty ****by discussing feedback together (rather than through your manager).  So you're developing from the development process itself!

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known.

QUESTION: Who is responsible for ensuring team members take enough time off?
=========
Content: # Holidays x

Your team members will sometimes not be present ?. No worries, they are just taking time off or recovering. Here's what you can do. 

**Holidays: time off ??**

If you haven't please take a look at the section about time off for everyone: 

[Taking Time off x](Taking%20Time%20off%20x%2000c8b7bcab1a4b1ba5d285adb774b32d.md)

- Your team will put a request in for time off through Nmbrs. Nmbrs will inform you through email, you can accept or decline this request by clicking the link in the email.

[People System - Salarisbalie - Requesting Time off & Expensing](People%20System%20-%20Salarisbalie%20-%20Requesting%20Time%20off%20d436131e7b6840db95f13330ad7d3999.md)

- We only track this to have a handy overview of who is off and when, for example for planning around projects and releases.
- Keep in mind we don't pay out holidays at the end of the ride.
- Make sure people take enough time off (4-6 weeks per year) by bringing it up every once in a while. But: **it's their responsibility.**
- Make sure people **communicate** their time off well with the team and you. You have a say in this and you have to agree on someones time off (which will be fine in 99% of cases).
- Make sure your people put it in the **@all and their own agenda.**
- When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.

Content: - **Take care of your body and mind**
    
    
    **Take holidays and days off.**
    
    This one seems obvious, but we know it?s not. We believe that working at Blendle is the Premier League, the creme de la creme :). That takes it?s toll and asks a lot from your body and mind. These two need time to recharge from your efforts. Make sure to build in moments of absolute rest during the year. It?s called a holiday. Make sure to take 4 weeks, and make sure at least 2 of those are in a row. Advice would be to really go away: studies show that this works best. There are some studies showing that taking regular holidays (every quarter) are very effective. So don?t wait 6 months to take 2 weeks. Also take a week every now and then.
    
    **Don?t work when you?re sick**
    
    When you have the flu, stay at home. Get back to work when you are fully recovered. Don?t feel guilty about it (easier said than done, we know). Yes we miss you, but we can do it without you for a few days. Even better: with you being away, your team might have to rethink how certain things are done in your absence. It can cause a new (maybe better) way for tasks and responsibilities to be distributed and single points of failure can be discovered and fixed.
    
    **Food and exercise**

Content: - We work hard, we need time to reload and rest. Sometimes we work harder, so we need more. Some times we work less, so we need less.
    - We have something called 'life' happening which means we can't work because we have more important stuff to do.
    
    We want you to take enough rest to reload and recharge so you can be at your prime when working. Taking enough rest is as important as giving it your all when working. The well known on and off switch.
    
    The concept of work isn't always caught in time (40 hours) and place. Most of the people at Blendle don't keep track of time because time is such a limited variable to grasp the concept of work. There is a balance to strike here and just looking at hours or a holiday quota limits this discussion. 
    
    **That is why we don't keep track of holidays.**
    
    Our people don't have a holiday quota, but a moral obligation to their loved ones and Blendle to work hard and take enough time to rest. Alright, sounds heavy. How does that work?
    
    'Time off' can be divided into two buckets:
    
    1. **Holidays and national holidays**:
        
        Your contract states you have 4 weeks of paid time off per year, by law.

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","It is the responsibility of the team members to ensure they take enough time off. However, managers can encourage team members to take time off and remind them to do so. In cases of longer leaves of absence, managers can consult with HR for advice. Ultimately, it is the individual's responsibility to communicate their time off and ensure they take enough rest.",

QUESTION: What is the procedure for reporting a workplace harassment or discrimination complaint?
=========
Content: # Addressing harassment

You are *always* in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward when you report an incident. We encourage you to talk about what happened.

If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8). In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it?s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. 

Here are the steps you can take, either:

- **Talk to the offender**. If you suspect that an offender doesn?t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.

Content: ## **What you can expect from HR**

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.

Content: Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behavior is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn?t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions.

If you suspect that someone doesn?t realize their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when:

- Your lead, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.

This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

QUESTION: How is my salary determined?
=========
Content: # Salary Review

- **How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?**
    
    We weigh up several variables:
    
    - **Benchmark:** internal and external.
        
        The most accurate way to determine the range where someone should be is comparing someone with a peer internally. During the hiring process you find out at what level someone is and you'll be able to compare him or her internally. Who would you compare this person to in terms of level? Is he/she better than X? If you notice that everyone is not as good as the people we have, but are paid more: think about raising the salary of our people. Keep in mind that - especially in tech - the market is on tilt. Big corporate pay a lot of money to even mediocare people in tech. We don't want to compete with them and that is a choice for new hires to make. 
        
    - **Classic figures:** experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise.
        
        This is a bit old school in a way, but also at Blendle there is a difference between someone who is a starter with no experience or someone with 8 years of experience. For some jobs/roles we need certain skills, expertise or even education. This always comes with a price tag. 
        
    - **Scarcity & market value.**
Source: Notion_DB\Blendle's Employee Handbook a834d55573614857a48a9ce9ec4194e3\Salary Review fd385c04dff04c2bb298f7085bf9e78d.md

Content: - **Scarcity & market value.**
        
        It's fair to say that it's harder to fill some positions compared to some other roles. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.
        
    - **Role and responsibilities.**
        
        Certain roles and people make more impact than others. This is reflected in pay.
        
    - **Actual impact and contribution**
        
        Since we don't really like job titles, it's good to look at someone's actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? Can we try to put that in numbers or concrete projects?
        
    - **Someone's starting point**
        
        If we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.
        
    
    *Note: all of this is not an exact science and is determined together, so please: ask for help.*
    
- **When do we talk about money?**
    - **Yearly company wide salary raises in January**
        
        Every year (in January) we take a good look at all the salaries at Cafeyn- Blendle. Right after the feedback cycle (which we use as input) we have salary talks with everyone. We chose to do this once a year so we don't have a constant conversation about money through the year.
        
- **Off cycle salary increases**
Source: Notion_DB\Blendle's Employee Handbook a834d55573614857a48a9ce9ec4194e3\Salary Review fd385c04dff04c2bb298f7085bf9e78d.md

Content: - **Off cycle salary increases**
    
    **Contract renewal** is not a moment that automatically means it is time to talk about money. We are not a company of people who demand *""give me X or I walk''*.  
    
    People can bring up salary any moment they want and we take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high) - see ""**How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?""**
    
    **Good reasons to raise offcycle**
    
    - Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.
    - Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone's impact and capabilities. It's important to be able to quantify that curve.
    - New information internally or externally.
    - New information by benchmarking studies or during hiring.
    
    **Not so good reasons to give a raise**
    
    - Colleague got another offer and uses this to get a raise.
    - 'I earn X for this company, that's a lot of money, I want a piece of the pie'.
    - Colleague just wants an incentive to stay. Money is never the answer, because it will fade - very - fast.
- **Control questions**
    
    Now before you finally decide
    
    - If we had to hire someone today for X's job, what would we pay them?
    - What would it cost Blendle as a business to find a new person (hard to replace, scarcity, time to hire, impact on day to day business & product)?

    **Who is involved**: hiring manager/teamlead and HR
    
    **Timing follow-up:** asap
    
    **Goal:** make a fair offer and close
    
    **Note:** hiring manager = teamlead and is by default in the lead in this process. If you feel like it's better if HR or someone else does the offer: do so.
    
    **How:**
    
    1. **Determine offer:** hiring manager and HR determine salary offer together. 
    
    We weigh in several variables:

        The most accurate way to determine the range where someone should be is comparing someone with a peer internally.

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","Salaries at Blendle are determined based on several variables, including benchmarking, classic figures such as experience and education, scarcity and market value, role and responsibilities, actual impact and contribution, and someone's starting point. Salary reviews are conducted annually in January, and off-cycle salary increases can be discussed if there are drastic changes in role and responsibilities, steep learning curves, or new information internally or externally. It is important to have control questions in the decision-making process, such as considering what would be paid to hire someone for a particular job and the cost to the company of finding a new person. The responsibility for making a fair offer and closing the hiring process lies with the hiring manager/team lead and HR, who determine the salary offer based on benchmarking and classic figures.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: How many weeks of vacation are provided per year at Blendle?
=========
Content: # Taking Time off x

We kick off with the practical side of things and then dig into the idea behind it.

# Our time off policy

- Unlimited Vacation at Blendle
    - Time off is about the time you **need,** not about a **quota.**
    - At Blendle, **HR doesn't keep track** of your holidays **and we don't 'pay out' at the end of the ride.** When in doubt; less than 4 weeks is **not** enough, you may take more than that, just check with your lead if you're in doubt if it's reasonable.
    - **You can request for time off through Nmbrs** [https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/](https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/).   See People Systems section.       This way we have a handy overview of who is ooo and when. This helps when planning around bigger projects and releases etc. The overview is visible Blendle wide, cross teams. Don't worry if you end up with a negative balance, we top it up again in January! We like you to have at least 20 days off in a year. More can happen and is allowed. Here you can find more info on working with [Nmbrs](People%20System%20-%20Salarisbalie%20-%20Requesting%20Time%20off%20d436131e7b6840db95f13330ad7d3999.md)
    - You agree on your time off with your team(lead)
    - You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.

there is money in our bank account and it?s up to us to spend it wisely. So yes, there is a budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable for Blendle to pitch in.
- **Blendle outings:** 
the party agenda is pretty full. You?ll be invited when there is a party ahead.

Content: 2. **Life events:** 
        
        Life happens. Your cat dies, your car broke, you move to another city, you get married or have kids. Life events which all need your attention. We decided that we are not going to decide for you how much time you **get** for certain events. The question is: how much time do you actually **need.** 
        
        Most companies don't give you time off for funerals that are not for immediate relatives. We think we don't need a rule to tell us if that funeral is important for you. So take the time you need.

Content: # Referral bonus

Chances are that if you work at Blendle, you have great friends and peers who would also be fantastic additions to our team and who may be interested in one of the current [Job Openings](https://blendle.homerun.co/).

To help us grow our teams with exceptional people and encourage diversity in our hiring process, we will offer a referral bonus to any team member who helps us find an amazing hire:

**So, how does it work?**

- Referral bonuses are offered once the new team member is hired and has been with Blendle for **1 month.**
    1. Any position = ? 250 net for fulltime employment or pro ratio
        
        Currently open:
        
        - Product Designer
        
    2. Difficult to fill roles (e.g high demand, scarcity of skillset, seniority) = ? 1000 net for fulltime employment or pro ratio
        
        Currently open:
        
        - Sr Backend Engineer Ruby

Note: 0-hour(flex) and freelance openings are excluded from the referral programme.

**Can anyone refer someone?**

- YES! If you work at Blendle. No matter what role you are in, you can refer a candidate for any [open position.](https://blendle.homerun.co/)

**How can I refer someone?**

- Introduce your candidate by email to [People Operations or Recruitment](mailto:hr@blendle.com). This can be a full application (motivation/cv) or a sourcing lead.
- Introduce your candidate by email to [People Operations or Recruitment](mailto:hr@blendle.com) and have them apply through Homerun.

Content: - **Scarcity & market value.**
        
        It's fair to say that it's harder to fill some positions compared to some other roles. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.
        
    - **Role and responsibilities.**
        
        Certain roles and people make more impact than others. This is reflected in pay.
        
    - **Actual impact and contribution**
        
        Since we don't really like job titles, it's good to look at someone's actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? Can we try to put that in numbers or concrete projects?
        
    - **Someone's starting point**
        
        If we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.
        
    
    *Note: all of this is not an exact science and is determined together, so please: ask for help.*
    
- **When do we talk about money?**
    - **Yearly company wide salary raises in January**
        
        Every year (in January) we take a good look at all the salaries at Cafeyn- Blendle. Right after the feedback cycle (which we use as input) we have salary talks with everyone. We chose to do this once a year so we don't have a constant conversation about money through the year.
        
- **Off cycle salary increases**

This is just an outline and it isn?t meant to be complete. We have a lot of different characters at Blendle, but we do attract a certain type of person. This person usually has a big feeling of responsibility and a big drive and ambition. This type of person in particular is vulnerable to stress:

> ?In a way it?s ironic that this problem plagues Type-A players the most. The people who want to do their best and accomplish the most end up limiting themselves unintentionally. In startup culture, this usually manifests in people trying to have peak performance at work while also going to all the social events and being great to their families at the same time. Then they?re hard on themselves for not getting perfect marks in every category. As soon as they meet their own bar, they raise it.?

Alright, so here we are: we now know we have a potentially dangerous environment (startup, fast paced, a lot of changes, a lot of freedom, not always clear structure) and we attract certain type of people: responsible, perfectionist, driven, ambitious and hard on themselves.

Content: # Addressing harassment

You are *always* in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward when you report an incident. We encourage you to talk about what happened.

If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8). In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it?s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. 

Here are the steps you can take, either:

- **Talk to the offender**. If you suspect that an offender doesn?t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.

Content: ## **What you can expect from HR**

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

Content: # People System - Salarisbalie - Requesting Time off & Expensing

Salarisbalie is our payroll specialist and makes sure we get paid correctly every month, Salarisbalie works within a tool called NMBRS. NMBRS is used for saving and monitoring all personnel files,  personal information, holidays, dossiers, contracts, etc. 

When you start at Blendle, you get onboarded in this system. Easy peasy, everything in one place. 

You, HR and your lead have access to this self service tool.

So what can you do with Nmbrs?   Next to accessing your personal information and contracts, you can also change your contact information yourself. Plus, requesting time off and claiming expenses just became a whole lot easier: 

- **Time off request**
    
    **Why are we doing this if we have unlimited holidays?**
    The ""unlimited fair use"" rule stays. We are adding the balance for legal reasons. 
    
    And while we don't have a maximum, we do have a **minimum** that we want you to take, to keep you healthy - 20 days each year, for a 40 hour contract. 
    
    Plus, NMBRS has a super easy way to overview who is out of office and when, Blendle wide.  A great tool for teams and managers to plan work and availability especially around big projects or releases.

QUESTION: Why is it important for team leads to actively think about the possibility of someone leaving Blendle?
=========
Content: Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :). 
    

## Here's what you can do:

1. Actively **think** about the possibility that someone's time at Blendle is up. At least every month for everyone in your team.
2. **Flag** this at HR/MT when that happens. 
3. **Ask** for help if needed already at this stage.
4. **Analyse** (maybe together) the problem and give feedback to the person in question: try to get on the same page about where things go 'wrong'. These are pointers which might steer your thoughts. Real situations are always more complex. 
    - Someone is **underperforming**. Try using [the Matrix?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=0) to track down the areas where you think things should improve. Give actionable feedback and try to come up with concrete points to work on in his/her personal goals. Don't wait for the feedback cycle, the time is always now.
    - Someone **stopped growing or learning**. This isn't necessarily an immediate problem, but it can be because most people like working at Blendle because they grow and learn so much. Someone standing still for a year is a red flag.

Content: # What can Blendle do?

There?s a lot Blendle could improve and we?re working on that. The fact that we are a fast-paced startup with an aim to save journalism is not something that will change any time soon. This also means that we are facing a runway, which affects our everyday work. This is fuelling us to go the extra mile, but the downsides are also obvious.

So what can Blendle do?

- **Voicing vision & mission more:** everybody should feel connected to where Blendle is going and why. Talking about this more will help everybody align. This way everybody has more influence on the direction and it is more clear why a change of direction is made and how this affects your work.
- Open channels: **work on transparency and trust**: everybody should be able to speak up if they feel that the stress level is too high. Also when someone feels like they aren?t in the right role or simply doing work they don?t love everyday.
- **Build an environment which is less stressful.** This piece is step 1 on this point. Notice when people work too much. Tell people if we notice it and tell them to take action (go home, take holiday, work less, talk to someone). Let?s also keep improving the process we have in place for when people feel it?s too much.

Content: - Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

Content: - **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?
    
    Are you giving praise?
    
    Are you actively challenging your team?
    
    Are you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?
    
    Are you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?
    
    Is your schedule (and that of your team) in a healthy rhythm (work-life balance)? You set the example.
    
    Is your team taking regular holidays/long weekends?
    
    Here?s an article about how to help your team with this:

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","It is important for team leads to actively think about the possibility of someone leaving Blendle in order to address any issues or concerns that may arise. By actively considering this possibility, team leads can take proactive steps to flag the situation to HR/MT, ask for help if needed, analyze the problem, and provide feedback to the person in question. This allows for the opportunity to address any underperformance, lack of growth or learning, disagreement with the company or team direction, or other issues that may arise. By actively addressing these issues, team leads can work towards finding a solution and improving the situation. If the situation does not progress, it may be necessary to part ways with the individual. It is important for team leads to create a supportive and inclusive environment, provide regular feedback and praise, and ensure that the team is aligned with the company's vision and mission. Additionally, team leads should be aware of the work-life balance and well-being of their team members.

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.

QUESTION: Are there different study contracts based on the amount of money involved?
=========
Content: ## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how. Does this fit in someones personal development path at Blendle? Does it match the personal goals? Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

A good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own. The rest is common sense.

As leads you can decide to say Yes or No to budget requests based on the above questions. If you need help deciding, you can discuss with HR.

**?0-?250** = no study contract. Like a cool book, online course or a ticket to a summit.

**?250-1500 =** 12 months study contract. Like a full blown study/course or a conference (abroad).

**?1500** = edge case with 24 months study contract, please discuss with HR.

Content: - **Scarcity & market value.**
        
        It's fair to say that it's harder to fill some positions compared to some other roles. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.
        
    - **Role and responsibilities.**
        
        Certain roles and people make more impact than others. This is reflected in pay.
        
    - **Actual impact and contribution**
        
        Since we don't really like job titles, it's good to look at someone's actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? Can we try to put that in numbers or concrete projects?
        
    - **Someone's starting point**
        
        If we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.
        
    
    *Note: all of this is not an exact science and is determined together, so please: ask for help.*
    
- **When do we talk about money?**
    - **Yearly company wide salary raises in January**
        
        Every year (in January) we take a good look at all the salaries at Cafeyn- Blendle. Right after the feedback cycle (which we use as input) we have salary talks with everyone. We chose to do this once a year so we don't have a constant conversation about money through the year.
        
- **Off cycle salary increases**
Source: Notion_DB\Blendle's Employee Handbook a834d55573614857a48a9ce9ec4194e3\Salary Review fd385c04dff04c2bb298f7085bf9e78d.md

Content: - **Off cycle salary increases**
    
    **Contract renewal** is not a moment that automatically means it is time to talk about money. We are not a company of people who demand *""give me X or I walk''*.  
    
    People can bring up salary any moment they want and we take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high) - see ""**How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?""**
    
    **Good reasons to raise offcycle**
    
    - Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.
    - Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone's impact and capabilities. It's important to be able to quantify that curve.
    - New information internally or externally.
    - New information by benchmarking studies or during hiring.
    
    **Not so good reasons to give a raise**
    
    - Colleague got another offer and uses this to get a raise.
    - 'I earn X for this company, that's a lot of money, I want a piece of the pie'.
    - Colleague just wants an incentive to stay. Money is never the answer, because it will fade - very - fast.
- **Control questions**
    
    Now before you finally decide
    
    - If we had to hire someone today for X's job, what would we pay them?
    - What would it cost Blendle as a business to find a new person (hard to replace, scarcity, time to hire, impact on day to day business & product)?

There is money and time you can spend on celebrating stuff and for learning and development.

Apart from the Blendle-wide parties, outings and celebrations, we came up with a number for you to spend on team related stuff. **Every person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on fun stuff.** Why not ?80 or ?20? No good reason, we figured you could go out for dinner twice with your team for ?60. Every person keeps track of this for themselves.

Content: # Addressing harassment

You are *always* in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward when you report an incident. We encourage you to talk about what happened.

If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8). In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it?s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. 

Here are the steps you can take, either:

- **Talk to the offender**. If you suspect that an offender doesn?t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: # Blendle Social Code

**We want you to feel safe, happy, free and able to express yourself authentically at Blendle. We won?t tolerate any form of bad behaviour, racism or (sexual) harassment. If any of this is happening (or you have the slightest feeling of discomfort), please speak up. We?ll support you. If you don?t feel comfortable talking to any of us, you can talk to our [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) (not a public link) at any time.**

This part of our handbook describes our social code in more detail. This social code describes what is acceptable and unacceptable behaviour when working at Blendle and the steps we will take to restore the values when someone violates them.

We were inspired after reading [this example from Workable](https://resources.workable.com/employee-code-of-conduct-company-policy) and used that as a starting point for this document.

**Why do we need this social code?**

By setting out our code our goal is to make sure it is crystal clear what is OK and what?s not. It is a starting point for healthy discussions, and we hope to support any feeling of mistreatment with it.

Content: # Office

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?le is in charge of lunch ??sk her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","To file a formal complaint or grievance, employees should report the incident to HR, their team lead, or an outside confidential counselor. In serious cases like sexual assault, employees should also contact the police and inform HR of their intention to press charges. Employees have the option to talk to the offender directly or discuss the situation with their team lead, who may involve HR if necessary. It is important to provide as much detail and information as possible to assist in the investigation. The company will launch a disciplinary process based on the severity of the harassment, and in cases of sexual assault or coercion, the harasser will be terminated immediately. Employees found guilty of sexually assaulting another employee in a court of law will also be terminated, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Content: - You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.
    - This is a guideline.  If you have other national holidays you observe (eg Eid al-Fitr Suikerfeest, ending of Ramadan) feel free to work or be off when you want.
    
    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.
    - You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.
    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.
- **Backdrop**
    
    The law and additional ruling tell us what we can and can not do according to time off. We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:

Content: **Headspace**

To keep your head in shape, we pay for the best apps to help you do so: Headspace to stay calm and mindful and **Things** to boost your productivity and help you reach your goals. Blendle offers reimbursement on your Headspace subscription. Leave your name [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-zlsECyft1A7SV30dsbaxGeS7F66u2Yte7sOli8bc4k/edit?ts=5ae08e58#gid=0) and you will receive a monthly reimbursement together with your salary.

**Lunch**

At Blendle we tend to lunch together. Buurtboer arranges nice lunches including sandwiches (to be self-made), salad, eggs and veggies. Just get your plate, walk to the salad bar (yes we got a salad bar from Marktplaats for 100 euros), grab whatever you like and enjoy the company of your colleagues (or don?t, whatever). Any allergies or preferences? Let us know at [officemanagement@blendle.com](mailto:officemanagement@blendle.com).

Don?t be afraid to help out on cleaning up after lunch. You?ll experience this thing called gratitude if you do?

**[Sick](Calling%20in%20sick%20better%20ca3c036d25a24fcf988c410c9fc67108.md)?**

Tough luck! Get over it! No, we care for each other so we will feel sorry for you. And everyone is willing to help out if you get in a tough spot being ill at home. To get the needed help or rest, just let your team lead know you?re staying at home (or going home).

**Official Holidays and Vacay!**

Content: 2. **Life events:** 
        
        Life happens. Your cat dies, your car broke, you move to another city, you get married or have kids. Life events which all need your attention. We decided that we are not going to decide for you how much time you **get** for certain events. The question is: how much time do you actually **need.** 
        
        Most companies don't give you time off for funerals that are not for immediate relatives. We think we don't need a rule to tell us if that funeral is important for you. So take the time you need.
        
    
- Edge cases
    - Sabbatical: check with HR if you for example have plans to take a very long trip (longer then ~4 weeks).

FINAL ANSWER:","Blendle offers flexible holidays, with 4-6 weeks off per year, including at least one 2-week consecutive break. The specific arrangements for holidays can be discussed and agreed upon with the company. It is important to communicate and coordinate the dates with others and put them in the agenda. Flexibility goes both ways, and it is necessary to take enough time off and communicate clearly. The law and additional rulings provide guidelines, but Blendle encourages employees to think about their individual needs for time off.

Content: # What can I do

**Good news:** you can do something.

# 1. Check yourself:

When looking at all the things stated in chapter 3, you might recognize some stuff. In addition you can fill in this self test: 

[Burnout Self-Test: Are You at Risk?](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTCS_08.htm)

So how are you?

[]()

- I'm good!
    
    Great, take some time to realize why you are doing fine and take measures in order to prevent yourself from getting to stressed.
    
- I?m okay-ish, but something needs to change.
    - Start by telling your team lead that you feel like you have been on your toes for a while and you think you need time to recover. Also tell your team. Also tell HR.
    - Come up with a concrete 2 week plan (we can help you with that) to release some of the first pressure. This will mean a less busy sprint, shorter days, and maybe 2 weeks of 4 days to start with (or a holiday). The hours you gain, you can spend on things you enjoy and help you reload (Netflix, sports, cinema, go to the beach, visit friends, play with model trains). We learned that just doing nothing, doesn?t always help, so make sure to spend time on things you like.
    - During these two weeks you check in with your team lead how your stress level is. You can make it really concrete by giving your stress level a number (1-10).

Content: ## **The conversation**

Try initiating an open conversation by scheduling a meet on the first day of return to work, or at least as soon as you can. The purpose behind this conversation is not to judge someone for being absent. But it's meant to uncover the factors behind, or the cause of the absence. There is a good chance that you or Blendle can prevent the next absence by talking about this.

**Explain why you are having this conversation**

- Don't ask right away about the problems and sickness. Make clear that it's about being absent.
- Share a list of dates and patterns relevant to being absent.
- Talk about how the absence worries you, how it effects the team and anyone close to the team member.

**How to and what questions to ask:**

[Google Slides - create and edit presentations online, for free.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11TAG83sZkoXBBGi8pIOVTnYq0fyR5SkzuQUDZN4bQUk/edit#slide=id.p17)

**Notes**

- Always ask open questions.
- Know your facts, this will prevent unnecessary discussions. You can ask HR for the statics.
- Let your team member steer you towards the right solutions, don't fill in the blanks.
- Take notes, set goals and share them with each other afterwards.
- Monitor the progress, have recurring conversations about the situation and the goals.
- There is a fine barrier between being too pushy and being truly engaged and it's normal to feel that dilemma. Just use your own judgement.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Content: - **Scarcity & market value.**
        
        It's fair to say that it's harder to fill some positions compared to some other roles. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.
        
    - **Role and responsibilities.**
        
        Certain roles and people make more impact than others. This is reflected in pay.
        
    - **Actual impact and contribution**
        
        Since we don't really like job titles, it's good to look at someone's actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? Can we try to put that in numbers or concrete projects?
        
    - **Someone's starting point**
        
        If we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.
        
    
    *Note: all of this is not an exact science and is determined together, so please: ask for help.*
    
- **When do we talk about money?**
    - **Yearly company wide salary raises in January**
        
        Every year (in January) we take a good look at all the salaries at Cafeyn- Blendle. Right after the feedback cycle (which we use as input) we have salary talks with everyone. We chose to do this once a year so we don't have a constant conversation about money through the year.
        
- **Off cycle salary increases**

Content: # Salary Review

- **How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?**
    
    We weigh up several variables:
    
    - **Benchmark:** internal and external.
        
        The most accurate way to determine the range where someone should be is comparing someone with a peer internally. During the hiring process you find out at what level someone is and you'll be able to compare him or her internally. Who would you compare this person to in terms of level? Is he/she better than X? If you notice that everyone is not as good as the people we have, but are paid more: think about raising the salary of our people. Keep in mind that - especially in tech - the market is on tilt. Big corporate pay a lot of money to even mediocare people in tech. We don't want to compete with them and that is a choice for new hires to make. 
        
    - **Classic figures:** experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise.
        
        This is a bit old school in a way, but also at Blendle there is a difference between someone who is a starter with no experience or someone with 8 years of experience. For some jobs/roles we need certain skills, expertise or even education. This always comes with a price tag. 
        
    - **Scarcity & market value.**

Content: - **Telephone costs/reimbursements:** if you need to make a lot of phone calls for Blendle, we?ll reimburse your costs. Same goes for other costs.
        - **Pension:** we facilitate pensions via [Bright Pensioen](https://brightpensioen.nl/). Bright is not your standard pension plan. We think it?s better than the mandatory corporate pension scheme which you might be used to. [This video](https://youtu.be/xfZM2JuovJM?t=1941) explains a bit about pensions in general and it starts at the point where they explain what Bright Pensioen is and why we chose it. At the moment Blendle can?t afford a full blown pension plan, but we want to do what we can. That?s why Blendle pays the costs to Bright, so the money you put aside, goes straight to your pension. I also attached a presentation Bright did at Blendle.
        - **Option plan:** there is an Option plan. Options are worth a lot for us, because it is the most precious thing we have: a part of our company. So we don?t hand them out by default, we just want you to know it?s there and that we can explain the details to you later if you want.
        - **Laptop:** a good laptop is important, so you get one from us. Special needs? Let me know.
        - **Equipment:** we have electric sit-stand-desks and good chairs so your back stays in shape and there are more than enough screens and additional equipment at the office.
        - **Massages:** once a week, our masseuse gets rid of all our stress with her chair massages.

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror.

QUESTION: What are the criteria for getting a study contract?
=========
Content: ## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how. Does this fit in someones personal development path at Blendle? Does it match the personal goals? Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

A good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own. The rest is common sense.

As leads you can decide to say Yes or No to budget requests based on the above questions. If you need help deciding, you can discuss with HR.

**?0-?250** = no study contract. Like a cool book, online course or a ticket to a summit.

**?250-1500 =** 12 months study contract. Like a full blown study/course or a conference (abroad).

**?1500** = edge case with 24 months study contract, please discuss with HR.

Content: - **Classic figures:** age, experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise.
        
        This is a bit old school, but also at Blendle there is a difference between someone who is 20 years of age with no experience or 30 with 8 years experience. For some jobs/roles we need certain skills, expertise or even education. This always comes with a price tag. 
        
    - **Scarcity & market value**
        
        It's fair to say that is harder to find an iOS engineer than an HR officer. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.
        
    - **Role and responsibilities**
        
        Certain roles and people make more impact then others. This is reflected in pay.
        
    - **Actual impact and contribution**
        
        Since we don't really like job titles, it's good to look at someones actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? 
        
    - **Someone's starting point**
        
        If we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.

Content: ## **The conversation**

Try initiating an open conversation by scheduling a meet on the first day of return to work, or at least as soon as you can. The purpose behind this conversation is not to judge someone for being absent. But it's meant to uncover the factors behind, or the cause of the absence. There is a good chance that you or Blendle can prevent the next absence by talking about this.

**Explain why you are having this conversation**

- Don't ask right away about the problems and sickness. Make clear that it's about being absent.
- Share a list of dates and patterns relevant to being absent.
- Talk about how the absence worries you, how it effects the team and anyone close to the team member.

**How to and what questions to ask:**

[Google Slides - create and edit presentations online, for free.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11TAG83sZkoXBBGi8pIOVTnYq0fyR5SkzuQUDZN4bQUk/edit#slide=id.p17)

**Notes**

- Always ask open questions.
- Know your facts, this will prevent unnecessary discussions. You can ask HR for the statics.
- Let your team member steer you towards the right solutions, don't fill in the blanks.
- Take notes, set goals and share them with each other afterwards.
- Monitor the progress, have recurring conversations about the situation and the goals.
- There is a fine barrier between being too pushy and being truly engaged and it's normal to feel that dilemma. Just use your own judgement.

## **Recurring sickness ?**

If people call in sick more than 3 times in a year, that should raise a red flag. If you're leading one or more people, Arbo will also ping you if someone is calling in sick frequently. If sickness absence is recurring, consider if there is a [particular pattern or underlying issues](https://smallbusiness.co.uk/a-stepbystep-guideto-managing-repeated-employee-absence-2461572/) and initiate an open conversation about it.

Do not be afraid of honest discussions, these discussions help to identify return to work barriers and underlying issues. They also help to outline the expectations of all parties involved.

The open discussions encourage your team member to voice her/his concerns and request help. From the team members point of view, these discussions help to effectively manage and monitor sickness absence, particularly in most complex cases such as recurring absences. It also helps to ensure that the sickness management process is structured, consistent, clear and fair.

QUESTION: Why does Blendle prioritize diversity and inclusion?
=========
Content: - We believe being **inclusive** is important because it **fits our core values** of wanting to be a great place to work and really caring for each other. A place where people feel welcome and can be themselves. Inclusivity is crucial to our work environment and culture.
- We have trouble hiring diverse profiles. We noticed no flaws in the hiring process which would lead to favour a certain type of profile. We did notice that the 'pools' in which we are hiring (journalism and tech) are dominated by a certain profile which could explain this trend.
- We have open-minded people at Blendle who are willing and are becoming more aware.

**Some observations**:

- We tend to speak in Dutch in social settings. It can easily make non-Dutch people uncomfortable. We should speak English.
- The way we work (especially in meetings) suits extravert people better then introvert people.
- There is not a lot of variation on standard diversity variables like political views, religion, age, ethnicity, gender and educational background. Again, partly explained by the field we're in.
- Most of the leaders at Blendle are male.
- There is equal pay between men and women in the same role.
- We believe aiming for diversity numbers narrows the conversation on the topic for now. We decided to use the data to feed the conversation but not implement quotas.

**What we do:**

We know that we need to do better to make Blendle a more diverse workplace. We spend a lot of time thinking about diversity and inclusion. After reading, talking and listening, we learned a few things:

- This is a sensitive topic: feelings and opinions are involved.
- This is a trending topic: there is a lot of noise and it's hard to pin down the essence.
- This is not a new, but renewed topic.
- Diversity and inclusion is more of a scale than a simple yes or no statement.
- Everyone is biased and every company is at risk of becoming less diverse and inclusive.
- A more diverse and inclusive company **>** a less diverse and inclusive company for a lot of reasons.
- Diversity and inclusion is not 'just' about gender or race, so looking at just those numbers can limit your thoughts on this topic. The practical side of this topic is also way more subtle.

**Diversity and inclusion at Blendle**

What we know now:

- We believe in the importance of a **diverse** team because we believe **it's crucial to our succes and product.** We try to add meaning to peoples everyday life by helping them reach quality content instead of cat gifs on Facebook. This can only be done by a group of people with different backgrounds, expertise, personalities, talents, ideas and opinions.

Content: # What can Blendle do?

There?s a lot Blendle could improve and we?re working on that. The fact that we are a fast-paced startup with an aim to save journalism is not something that will change any time soon. This also means that we are facing a runway, which affects our everyday work. This is fuelling us to go the extra mile, but the downsides are also obvious.

So what can Blendle do?

- **Voicing vision & mission more:** everybody should feel connected to where Blendle is going and why. Talking about this more will help everybody align. This way everybody has more influence on the direction and it is more clear why a change of direction is made and how this affects your work.
- Open channels: **work on transparency and trust**: everybody should be able to speak up if they feel that the stress level is too high. Also when someone feels like they aren?t in the right role or simply doing work they don?t love everyday.
- **Build an environment which is less stressful.** This piece is step 1 on this point. Notice when people work too much. Tell people if we notice it and tell them to take action (go home, take holiday, work less, talk to someone). Let?s also keep improving the process we have in place for when people feel it?s too much.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.

QUESTION: How can I accept or decline a time-off request?
=========
Content: # Holidays x

Your team members will sometimes not be present ?. No worries, they are just taking time off or recovering. Here's what you can do. 

**Holidays: time off ??**

If you haven't please take a look at the section about time off for everyone: 

[Taking Time off x](Taking%20Time%20off%20x%2000c8b7bcab1a4b1ba5d285adb774b32d.md)

- Your team will put a request in for time off through Nmbrs. Nmbrs will inform you through email, you can accept or decline this request by clicking the link in the email.

[People System - Salarisbalie - Requesting Time off & Expensing](People%20System%20-%20Salarisbalie%20-%20Requesting%20Time%20off%20d436131e7b6840db95f13330ad7d3999.md)

- We only track this to have a handy overview of who is off and when, for example for planning around projects and releases.
- Keep in mind we don't pay out holidays at the end of the ride.
- Make sure people take enough time off (4-6 weeks per year) by bringing it up every once in a while. But: **it's their responsibility.**
- Make sure people **communicate** their time off well with the team and you. You have a say in this and you have to agree on someones time off (which will be fine in 99% of cases).
- Make sure your people put it in the **@all and their own agenda.**
- When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.

- When people work hard, **poke them** to take time off so they recharge.
- For longer leaves of absence (~4 weeks) ping HR for advice.

Content: - You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.
    - This is a guideline.  If you have other national holidays you observe (eg Eid al-Fitr Suikerfeest, ending of Ramadan) feel free to work or be off when you want.
    
    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.
    - You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.
    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.
- **Backdrop**
    
    The law and additional ruling tell us what we can and can not do according to time off. We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:

FINAL ANSWER:","To accept or decline a time-off request, you can do so through Nmbrs. When a team member puts in a request for time off, Nmbrs will inform you through email and you can click the link in the email to accept or decline the request. It is also important to communicate with the team and ensure that the time off is agreed upon by all parties. In certain situations, such as for longer leaves of absence, you can consult with HR for advice. Additionally, if there are specific national holidays or observances that team members want to take off, they can work or be off when they want, as long as they communicate it clearly and put it in the agenda. It is important to note that time off should be taken responsibly and enough time off should be taken to recharge, as it is the responsibility of the individual to ensure they take enough time off. If you have any doubts or questions, you can always consult with HR for guidance.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: What can we do to address fading morale in the workplace?
=========
Content: We know this adds to your tally. Again, just becoming aware of this already helps.

And also again, when you see something causing a lot of stress, let?s get to work on it. Not digging the new team structure? Not feeling your current role? Not happy with your team lead? Bring it up with someone you trust (HR, your team lead, Alexander, just anyone) and let?s try to fix it or at least talk about it.

Blendle cares. We care. So if you?re struggling, let?s change things to make sure you are happy, healthy and at your best.

# 3. Make changes: here are some quick wins

- **Look at your work life balance**
    
    
    > In engineering, people talk about asset integrity, which means that you service the machinery before it breaks. In modern organizations, the work is thinking and the machinery is your brain. We know from cognitive science that there are hard limits to what the brain can deal with. And yet, there?s an awful lot in the way we work which flies in the face of that. We think that if we work through the night, we?re being very clever. We?re not. We think we can work long hours ? month after month, year after year ? and that there won?t be any wear and tear. But there is.

Content: - Address it if you feel morale is fading. It can be a red flag. Is it one person? One situation? One team? One project? Or is it more?
    
- **Culture**
    
    Lead by example when it comes to culture. We tried pinning down our DNA by writing down our operating principles but we came to the conclusion it's essentially all about you. The people themselves are the culture and we guard that culture. What you stand for, what you believe in and how we treat each other is part of our DNA. So be yourself and keep expressing yourself to your team. 'This is not how we do things' is a totally fine comment. Don't forget to explain why though :).
    
    Check our page about culture and values here:

- **Relate and care personally**
    
    The people around you are probably one of the reasons you like working at Blendle. We are not robots, so relate to your team. As a lead, it's good to **invest in personal relationships**. This will help you in so many ways.

Content: - **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?
    
    Are you giving praise?
    
    Are you actively challenging your team?
    
    Are you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?
    
    Are you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?
    
    Is your schedule (and that of your team) in a healthy rhythm (work-life balance)? You set the example.
    
    Is your team taking regular holidays/long weekends?
    
    Here?s an article about how to help your team with this:

Content: - Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?le is in charge of lunch ??sk her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

**Snacks and more**

Content: - You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.
    - This is a guideline.  If you have other national holidays you observe (eg Eid al-Fitr Suikerfeest, ending of Ramadan) feel free to work or be off when you want.
    
    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.
    - You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.
    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.
- **Backdrop**
    
    The law and additional ruling tell us what we can and can not do according to time off. We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror.

FINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.

QUESTION: What are the key aspects of the lunch provided in the office canteen?
=========
Content: # Office

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?le is in charge of lunch ??sk her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

---

**Snacks and more**
Source: Notion_DB\Blendle's Employee Handbook a834d55573614857a48a9ce9ec4194e3\Office d0ebcaaa2074442ba155c67a41d315dd.md

Content: ---

**Snacks and more**

There will be beer, soda and snacks after All-hands presentations. 

On any other regular day:

- We might have chips etc, but op = op. We order snacks sometimes.
- This also goes for the cookies, fizzy drinks, beer or club mate.
- Fruit is something we want to provide everyday. If you notice we run out of fruit too fast and too often, ping our Office Manager so she can fix this.

If you are a big snack lover or don't want to be left empty-handed, consider bringing your own snacks.

---

**Clean up your shit**

You need to clean up your own shit. Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don't forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine. This 'system' works really well and keeps us away from bullshit like dishwasher duty.

Fahima is here every day, twice a day to clean this place, including toilets. 

---

**Think about the environment.**

Kill the lights. Turn down the heating. Don't waste paper #deadtrees. We separate our garbage into paper, glass, plastics and rest. Don't waste food: feel free to take home bread on Friday.

To keep your head in shape, we pay for the best apps to help you do so: Headspace to stay calm and mindful and **Things** to boost your productivity and help you reach your goals. Blendle offers reimbursement on your Headspace subscription.

**Lunch**

At Blendle we tend to lunch together. Buurtboer arranges nice lunches including sandwiches (to be self-made), salad, eggs and veggies. Just get your plate, walk to the salad bar (yes we got a salad bar from Marktplaats for 100 euros), grab whatever you like and enjoy the company of your colleagues (or don?t, whatever). Any allergies or preferences? Let us know at [officemanagement@blendle.com](mailto:officemanagement@blendle.com).

Don?t be afraid to help out on cleaning up after lunch. You?ll experience this thing called gratitude if you do?

**[Sick](Calling%20in%20sick%20better%20ca3c036d25a24fcf988c410c9fc67108.md)?**

Tough luck! Get over it! No, we care for each other so we will feel sorry for you. And everyone is willing to help out if you get in a tough spot being ill at home. To get the needed help or rest, just let your team lead know you?re staying at home (or going home).

**Official Holidays and Vacay!**
Source: Notion_DB\Blendle's Employee Handbook a834d55573614857a48a9ce9ec4194e3\YOUR first week x 940621ae57e54c39aa5ded6e1b49cf4d.md

Content: **Food and exercise**
    
    Crucial to feeling well, is taking care of your body. Studies show that exercise is crucial when having a demanding job. That doesn?t mean we want you all to be fitgirls and fitboys. But: get moving. Go skating, hiking, biking, surfing, do yoga. Do something. Your body isn?t made to sit in a chair all day. Use the facilities at the office (standing desks and desk bikes) and try to go for a walk every day (is the 1on1-walk a thing yet?). The things you consume also affect this of course, no secrets there. Take care of yourself by consuming good stuff. No rocket science: just more veggies and water, less alcohol and smoking. Take care of yourself.
    
    **When something is wrong: go see a doctor:**
    
    Don?t wait too long to go see a doctor or therapist. It?s very normal to talk to a psychologist or coach every once in awhile. Just as normal as visiting a physiotherapist for back pain because you have an office job.
    
- **Setting priorities right and saying no (I know this is hard)**
    
    
    1. You, your family, friends and loved ones
    2. Blendle
    
    It?s important to know what the right order is. Your health comes first. Your loved ones come first. We want you to pay attention to your number 1 priority and have your private life in order. Because if it?s not, it will add to your stress level.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

=========
Content: # Learning Budget

There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely.  Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? 

Does Blendle benefit from the fact that you are spending time and money on learning and development? 

Does this fit in your personal development path at Blendle? 

Does it match personal goals? 

Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

Would you spend the money on this if it was your own?

**Talk to your Lead, and they will help decide with finance for learning budget requests.**

Content: - **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?
    
    Are you giving praise?
    
    Are you actively challenging your team?
    
    Are you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?
    
    Are you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?
    
    Is your schedule (and that of your team) in a healthy rhythm (work-life balance)? You set the example.
    
    Is your team taking regular holidays/long weekends?
    
    Here?s an article about how to help your team with this:

Content: How does that look? Sometimes it?s better to skip a morning stand-up to visit a physio for your constant headache. You are acting in Blendle?s interest when doing this.
    
- **Check your work, job and role**
    
    
    Are you doing the right job? Do you get energy from what you are doing? Do you feel like you?re making a difference? Do you love most of it? Of course there will be stuff you don?t like, that?s totally normal. But are you doing things you are good at and you like? And is there enough challenge, perspective and room to grow?
    
    Are you getting enough praise and feedback? Do you know what is expected from you? Do you know how you are doing at the moment?
    
    It?s really important that you know how your team and team leads think you are doing. Ask them! What are you doing well, what needs to improve. Use the structure we came up with: 1on1?s, personal goals, feedback sessions, peer reviews. But feel free to alter them in order for them to work for you. Just don?t do nothing.
    
- **Last but not least: get informed.**
    
    There is a lot of information out there. Inform yourself. It will help you recognize a potential threat earlier and help you act on that. 
    
    Going to the [**Good Reads**](Good%20reads%20e975bced442d483c8c510d54e958444d.md) page is a great place to start :).

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: ## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how. Does this fit in someones personal development path at Blendle? Does it match the personal goals? Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

A good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own. The rest is common sense.

As leads you can decide to say Yes or No to budget requests based on the above questions. If you need help deciding, you can discuss with HR.

**?0-?250** = no study contract. Like a cool book, online course or a ticket to a summit.

**?250-1500 =** 12 months study contract. Like a full blown study/course or a conference (abroad).

**?1500** = edge case with 24 months study contract, please discuss with HR.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.

QUESTION: What are the important reminders for hiring and relocating highly skilled migrants?
=========
Content: - It's important to inform the candidates about the (lack of) housing in Utrecht, be realistic.
- We offer a relocation packages which can be customised within some boundries.
- IND requires a certain amount of income from the migrants. The amounts can be [found here](https://ind.nl/en/Pages/required-amounts-income_requirement.aspx#Application_residence_permit_highly_skilled_migrant_and_EU_blue_card).
- New hires can be eligible for the [30% ruling](https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/living/take-care-of-official-matters/highly-skilled-migrants/thirty-percent-ruling) for the duration of 5 years. They can consult [this page](https://thetax.nl/?year=2019&startFrom=Year&salary=36000&allowance=0&socialSecurity=1&retired=0&ruling=0&rulingChoice=normal) for a general calculation of the 30% ruling.

Content: ### Where to start

We can basically hire anyone from anywhere in the world. But the migration and relocation procedure will be different for some countries. It's good to know that the migration procedure and relocation can take up to 8 weeks. So when interviewing a new candidate, that should be something to be aware of.  The information below should give you a good idea of what the differences are between different countries. 

As a lead, if you want to move forward with a candidate and make an offer, please contact HR for support first. In general the procedure looks like something like this:

1. There is a green light after the pair session;
2. Contact HR to discuss the salary, startdate and the relocation offer. In some cases HR needs to contact EMG in advance to check some legal stuff;
3. You have a ""yes"" from our candidate? HR can take over from here and will start the procedure with EMG;
4. HR will keep you up to date and help you with the on-boarding;
5. HR needs to be up to date about renewals or any other significant changes in salary or contract. These things have consequences for the work permit of our new colleague.

## Some important reminders

- It can take up to 8 weeks before a new hire can actually start working at Blendle.
- It's important to inform the candidates about the (lack of) housing in Utrecht, be realistic.
- We offer a relocation packages which can be customised within some boundries.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

    - My teamlead does not micromanage (i.e., get involved in details that should be handled at other levels).
    - My teamlead regularly shares relevant info and/or insights from the MT.
    - My teamlead is easy to approach with problems/concerns/feedback.

Content: # Our Feedback Process

> At Blendle we value the **Freedom** and **Responsibility** of giving **Proactive** and **Honest** feedback to drive excellent **Team Work**.   We try to build input points into everything we do.  We even got feedback on upgrading our Feedback process - all of which is incorporated into the new process below.
> 

# **Typical Feedback Moments @ Blendle:**

- **Sprint retro** - every 2 weeks.  How did the cycle go?  What did we learn? How did we feel?
- **Agile Process retro** - Monthly.  How can we improve the process and collaboration?
- **BIG HR People Surve**y - two times a year Q1 and Q4 on Employee experience.
- **EVERYDAY!**

# The **Quarterly Coaching Feedback Process**

At least every Quarter we want to make sure you get a formal feedback and coaching conversation focused on your personal and professional development, and progress.  And luckily, the quarterly process aligns to the timing of our Objectives Goals Strategies Measures, so you can chat about both with your manager at the same time.

### The Process:

**YOU** run ***your*** process - End to End.  By having full ownership you control your development (that ****responsible** value again ?) and focus on **teamwork** **and ****honesty ****by discussing feedback together (rather than through your manager).  So you're developing from the development process itself!

Content: Don't wait for a review cycle or contract which expires to give this a thought.
    
- Optional: **Skip level session and upward feedback**
    
    **Skip level session:** 
    
    Also called an upward feedback session. A session where your team members sit down with your lead to talk about you. Your lead makes notes and shares them with you afterwords. 
    
    ?If you?re a manager of managers, you need to make sure that everyone on your team feels they can criticize their boss,? Scott says. But she?s quick to note that this does not mean encouraging your team to be boss killers. Instead, she recommends putting this advice into practice with a simple meeting ? commonly called a 'skip-level meeting,' though that sounds hierarchical, so she prefers to call them 'manager guidance sessions.'
    
    The process is straightforward: First, let your managers know that you?ll be scheduling a meeting with their direct reports. Get them comfortable with the idea, and make it clear that this meeting is intended to be helpful to them. Then explain the process to the reports, again making it clear that the goal of the meeting is to help their boss be a better manager ? and that the meeting is not for attribution.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: Who can I discuss my budget requests with if I need help deciding?
=========
Content: # Learning Budget

There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely.  Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? 

Does Blendle benefit from the fact that you are spending time and money on learning and development? 

Does this fit in your personal development path at Blendle? 

Does it match personal goals? 

Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

Would you spend the money on this if it was your own?

**Talk to your Lead, and they will help decide with finance for learning budget requests.**

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how. Does this fit in someones personal development path at Blendle? Does it match the personal goals? Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

A good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own. The rest is common sense.

As leads you can decide to say Yes or No to budget requests based on the above questions. If you need help deciding, you can discuss with HR.

**?0-?250** = no study contract. Like a cool book, online course or a ticket to a summit.

**?250-1500 =** 12 months study contract. Like a full blown study/course or a conference (abroad).

**?1500** = edge case with 24 months study contract, please discuss with HR.

Content: # Party and study budget

There is money and time you can spend on celebrating stuff and for learning and development. We want you, as a Team Lead, to feel free to spend this money and time within these boundaries so you don't need permission every time you spend it on these two topics. We want to create clarity so you have the liberty?o spend money on this. We don't want to limit your thinking by coming up with a budget, so feel free to ask HR if you'd like to bend the budgets for a good reason.

You are in the lead for these two topics for your team. 

## Party budget

Apart from the Blendle-wide parties, outings and celebrations, we came up with a number for you to spend on team related stuff. **Every person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on fun stuff.** Why not ?80 or ?20? No good reason, we figured you could go out for dinner twice with your team for ?60. Every person keeps track of this for themselves.

Content: - **Off cycle salary increases**
    
    **Contract renewal** is not a moment that automatically means it is time to talk about money. We are not a company of people who demand *""give me X or I walk''*.  
    
    People can bring up salary any moment they want and we take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high) - see ""**How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?""**
    
    **Good reasons to raise offcycle**
    
    - Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.
    - Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone's impact and capabilities. It's important to be able to quantify that curve.
    - New information internally or externally.
    - New information by benchmarking studies or during hiring.
    
    **Not so good reasons to give a raise**
    
    - Colleague got another offer and uses this to get a raise.
    - 'I earn X for this company, that's a lot of money, I want a piece of the pie'.
    - Colleague just wants an incentive to stay. Money is never the answer, because it will fade - very - fast.
- **Control questions**
    
    Now before you finally decide
    
    - If we had to hire someone today for X's job, what would we pay them?
    - What would it cost Blendle as a business to find a new person (hard to replace, scarcity, time to hire, impact on day to day business & product)?

- Don?t save all your feedback up - give at the time of the event (or shortly after) -  There should be no surprises
- Don't make it personal.  Focus on the situation not the person. and how you can work together to improve it for next time.
- Examples are fine, but don't use them for the blame game.
- Reflect on your intention in giving someone your feedback. Are you giving it to help someone or to shame someone?  Did you have a role in the situation that happened?
- Be clear and direct, subtle gibberish doesn't help anyone.
- Remember A-P-P-R-E-C-I-A-T-I-O-N helps motivate and shows people their unique value.

? Tips for r**eceiving feedback**

</aside>

- Always assume feedback is given to help you
- Be open to listening and don't get stuck in a spiral of defending or pointing fingers back.
Take responsibility if something went wrong and focus on learning how to work together better.
- Be curious - Why is this feedback given to you? What is really at the root of it?  Is it the feedback itself that indicates a problem or is some emotion underlying it that needs to be addressed?

Content: # Our Feedback Process

> At Blendle we value the **Freedom** and **Responsibility** of giving **Proactive** and **Honest** feedback to drive excellent **Team Work**.   We try to build input points into everything we do.  We even got feedback on upgrading our Feedback process - all of which is incorporated into the new process below.
> 

# **Typical Feedback Moments @ Blendle:**

- **Sprint retro** - every 2 weeks.  How did the cycle go?  What did we learn? How did we feel?
- **Agile Process retro** - Monthly.  How can we improve the process and collaboration?
- **BIG HR People Surve**y - two times a year Q1 and Q4 on Employee experience.
- **EVERYDAY!**

# The **Quarterly Coaching Feedback Process**

At least every Quarter we want to make sure you get a formal feedback and coaching conversation focused on your personal and professional development, and progress.  And luckily, the quarterly process aligns to the timing of our Objectives Goals Strategies Measures, so you can chat about both with your manager at the same time.

### The Process:

**YOU** run ***your*** process - End to End.  By having full ownership you control your development (that ****responsible** value again ?) and focus on **teamwork** **and ****honesty ****by discussing feedback together (rather than through your manager).  So you're developing from the development process itself!

Content: - **Continuous Feedback**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Don?t save up feedback, it?s less powerful. Just speak your mind. The more often you do this, the easier it gets. This goes both ways: good and bad. I never heard someone say he or she got too much feedback.
    
    **How?** 
    
    Face to face is best (e-mail/slack/chat is ok for practical stuff).
    
    Praise in public, feedback 1on1.
    
    Think about:
    
    - quality of work: you did well on X. Because ABC.
    - way of working: you were slow and distracted, how can I help?
    - behaviour: try not to interrupt people during the meeting.
    
    There are a lot of tips out there on how to give feedback.
    
    I like the HIP-approach:
    
    - **H**umble
    - **H**elpful
    - **I**mmediate
    - **I**n person
    - **P**rivate criticism/ **P**ublic Praise
    - Not about **P**ersonality
    
    Source:
    
    [A HIP Approach to Feedback | Achieve Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/a-hip-approach-to-feedback/)
    
- **Have scheduled (bi-)weekly 1on1's**
    
    **Why?**
    
    It?s important and it's not going to happen if you don?t schedule it. If all is fine it might feel too much. It isn?t. Goal is to ?stay in touch? and simply have a relationship with someone. The relationship is the basis for being able to give good feedback and it makes it easier to receive too.
    
    **How?**

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.

Content: 2. Salary:
        
        Nothing changes here. Blendle pays your full salary.
        
    3. Duration of maternity leave:
        
        By law you are entitled to 16 weeks of paid maternity leave. And you decide when your leave starts. The leave can start anywhere between 6-4 weeks before your due date. If you are pregnant with twins or more... you can leave between 10-8 weeks before your due date. Please let us know if you encounter unexpected complications during this time. We understand it's not always easy and will do our best to accommodate your situation.
        
        There are a couple more exceptions that can affect your maternity leave. You can either contact HR for more info or [visit the government?s info page.](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/zwangerschapsverlof-en-bevallingsverlof/vraag-en-antwoord/hoe-lang-duurt-zwangerschapsverlof-en-bevallingsverlof)
        
    
    **To-do during pregnancy:**
    
    1. At least 3 months before your due date:
        - Tell your lead and HR that you are pregnant
        - Show your pregnancy statement to HR
    2. At least 3 weeks before your leave:
        - Together with your lead, set a date for your leave and inform HR
        - Discuss possible work-related adjustments with your lead (like parental leave, breastfeeding)
    3. Within 4 weeks after birth:
        - Inform HR of the birth date
        - Let your lead and HR know if you need anything when you are back at work

Content: **It looks weird in the system.....I see a negative balance!**
    
    For everyone with a 40 hours contract, the **minimum balance is set as 20 days** in NMBRS each year, and this re-sets at the start of each year.  In the case that you didn't take all 20 days by end of December (we hope this is not the case as you should take the advised minimum, at a minimum), these days will show in your balance for the next year for 6 months.
    
    (note: as we are introducing the tool in June 2020, the remaining balance is 10 for 2020, that's half of the normal balance)
    
    On the other hand, if **you exceed this minimum balance** you will show as negative in the system.  Nothing to worry about **-** remember... **we don't track your holidays in that kind of way**.  As long as your manager has agreed to your holidays and you have added your request, it's fine to go negative. 
    
    **How do I submit my holiday plans?**
    After discussing your time off with your lead and team, go to NMBRS to submit the request. To do so, log in to your [https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/](https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/) account and choose ""Verlof"". Fill in the dates, reason, save it and done!. Your lead will get a signal to approve the request through NMBRS.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: # Party and study budget

There is money and time you can spend on celebrating stuff and for learning and development. We want you, as a Team Lead, to feel free to spend this money and time within these boundaries so you don't need permission every time you spend it on these two topics. We want to create clarity so you have the liberty?o spend money on this. We don't want to limit your thinking by coming up with a budget, so feel free to ask HR if you'd like to bend the budgets for a good reason.

You are in the lead for these two topics for your team. 

## Party budget

Apart from the Blendle-wide parties, outings and celebrations, we came up with a number for you to spend on team related stuff. **Every person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on fun stuff.** Why not ?80 or ?20? No good reason, we figured you could go out for dinner twice with your team for ?60. Every person keeps track of this for themselves.  

## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in.""

        Life happens. Your cat dies, your car broke, you move to another city, you get married or have kids. Life events which all need your attention.

        Most companies don't give you time off for funerals that are not for immediate relatives. We think we don't need a rule to tell us if that funeral is important for you. So take the time you need.

**Snacks and more**

There will be beer, soda and snacks after All-hands presentations. 

On any other regular day:

- We might have chips etc, but op = op. We order snacks sometimes.
- This also goes for the cookies, fizzy drinks, beer or club mate.
- Fruit is something we want to provide everyday. If you notice we run out of fruit too fast and too often, ping our Office Manager so she can fix this.

If you are a big snack lover or don't want to be left empty-handed, consider bringing your own snacks.

**Clean up your shit**

You need to clean up your own shit. Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don't forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine. This 'system' works really well and keeps us away from bullshit like dishwasher duty.

Fahima is here every day, twice a day to clean this place, including toilets.

**Think about the environment.**

Kill the lights. Turn down the heating. Don't waste paper #deadtrees. We separate our garbage into paper, glass, plastics and rest. Don't waste food: feel free to take home bread on Friday.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Content: # General disciplinary measures

Our Social code is crystal clear and very easily to follow. However, we also want to be clear about the consequences if for any reason you fail to follow the rules:

- **Verbal warning.** When we find it necessary to formally give you a warning. It might be a minor violation or your first time.
- **Official written warning**.  You will receive an official written warning for any serious breach of Blendle?s social code. This also applies when you already have had a maximum of two verbal warnings and your behavior hasn't improved. After 1 official written warning, we will move on to more serious measures like suspension or termination.
- **Suspension.** This happens when you have committed a very serious offense, or when we need time to investigate a case. Your access to Blendle will be temporarily revoked until it's clear whether and which measures should be taken.
- **Termination.** When the violation is of a very serious nature. These violations are most of the time determined by law and because of the severity of the act, we can terminate your contract immediately. Or, after an official written warning.

## When do we apply these measures

When we apply a measure, which measure we apply, and how long we apply it always depends on the situation and severity of the violation.

- Any form of harassment including bullying, intimidation, malicious gossip and victimisation of your colleagues, either inside or outside of the office.

Content: - Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

Content: **It looks weird in the system.....I see a negative balance!**
    
    For everyone with a 40 hours contract, the **minimum balance is set as 20 days** in NMBRS each year, and this re-sets at the start of each year.  In the case that you didn't take all 20 days by end of December (we hope this is not the case as you should take the advised minimum, at a minimum), these days will show in your balance for the next year for 6 months.
    
    (note: as we are introducing the tool in June 2020, the remaining balance is 10 for 2020, that's half of the normal balance)
    
    On the other hand, if **you exceed this minimum balance** you will show as negative in the system.  Nothing to worry about **-** remember... **we don't track your holidays in that kind of way**.  As long as your manager has agreed to your holidays and you have added your request, it's fine to go negative. 
    
    **How do I submit my holiday plans?**
    After discussing your time off with your lead and team, go to NMBRS to submit the request. To do so, log in to your [https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/](https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/) account and choose ""Verlof"". Fill in the dates, reason, save it and done!. Your lead will get a signal to approve the request through NMBRS.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

QUESTION: What is the recommended approach for making notes on feedback?
=========
Content: # Leading Feedback

We can not stress enough how we value feedback in all its forms.?*Good feedback is at the center of all people-related topics**. Good feedback is the key to a good collaboration, happy people and even a successful company. As a lead, you are responsible for leading the feedback for your people. This section will help you do so. Look at this list as a toolkit for you and your colleagues. 

[Our Feedback Process](Our%20Feedback%20Process%20c40fc80d546045ffb7076797301e81a8.md)

- **Make notes**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Well, because you forget. Plus making notes forces you to constantly think about the feedback. We would recommend making it a habit at the end of the week (weekly review ftw!): how did X do? 
    
    If you have a good system, it will also allow you to look back. ?Didn?t we discuss this already a year ago? It?s still an issue?. It also shows that you don?t forget and take this seriously.
    
    **How?**
    
    Docs, Evernote, Todoist, Wunderlist, Word, Things or even a notebook (I would not recommend a notebook). Whatever works. Just make small notes: You did well on project X and meeting Y, because ABC. I really liked when you did X, because it had an effect on ABC. It helps you during the reviews every 6 months.
    
- **Continuous Feedback**
    
    **Why?**

- Don?t save all your feedback up - give at the time of the event (or shortly after) -  There should be no surprises
- Don't make it personal.  Focus on the situation not the person. and how you can work together to improve it for next time.
- Examples are fine, but don't use them for the blame game.
- Reflect on your intention in giving someone your feedback. Are you giving it to help someone or to shame someone?  Did you have a role in the situation that happened?
- Be clear and direct, subtle gibberish doesn't help anyone.
- Remember A-P-P-R-E-C-I-A-T-I-O-N helps motivate and shows people their unique value.

<aside>
? Tips for r**eceiving feedback**

</aside>

- Always assume feedback is given to help you
- Be open to listening and don't get stuck in a spiral of defending or pointing fingers back.
Take responsibility if something went wrong and focus on learning how to work together better.
- Be curious - Why is this feedback given to you? What is really at the root of it?  Is it the feedback itself that indicates a problem or is some emotion underlying it that needs to be addressed?

Content: - **Continuous Feedback**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Don?t save up feedback, it?s less powerful. Just speak your mind. The more often you do this, the easier it gets. This goes both ways: good and bad. I never heard someone say he or she got too much feedback.
    
    **How?** 
    
    Face to face is best (e-mail/slack/chat is ok for practical stuff).
    
    Praise in public, feedback 1on1.
    
    Think about:
    
    - quality of work: you did well on X. Because ABC.
    - way of working: you were slow and distracted, how can I help?
    - behaviour: try not to interrupt people during the meeting.
    
    There are a lot of tips out there on how to give feedback.
    
    I like the HIP-approach:
    
    - **H**umble
    - **H**elpful
    - **I**mmediate
    - **I**n person
    - **P**rivate criticism/ **P**ublic Praise
    - Not about **P**ersonality
    
    Source:
    
    [A HIP Approach to Feedback | Achieve Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/a-hip-approach-to-feedback/)
    
- **Have scheduled (bi-)weekly 1on1's**
    
    **Why?**
    
    It?s important and it's not going to happen if you don?t schedule it. If all is fine it might feel too much. It isn?t. Goal is to ?stay in touch? and simply have a relationship with someone. The relationship is the basis for being able to give good feedback and it makes it easier to receive too.

FINAL ANSWER:","The recommended approach for making notes on feedback is to use a system such as Docs, Evernote, Todoist, Wunderlist, Word, or a notebook. It is recommended to make small notes, highlighting both positive and negative aspects of the feedback, and to review these notes during regular reviews. Additionally, continuous feedback is encouraged, with face-to-face communication being the most effective method. It is important to provide feedback in a humble, helpful, immediate, and in-person manner, focusing on the quality of work, way of working, and behavior. Scheduled 1-on-1 meetings are also recommended to maintain a relationship and facilitate feedback.

QUESTION: How does the semi-flex workspace arrangement function in our office?
=========
Content: # Office

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?le is in charge of lunch ??sk her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

You can park your car [here](http://www.parkeren-utrecht.nl/parkeergarage-moreelsepark). Our Office Manager will get you a parking card asap (if you plan to come by car often). Until then, you can get a get-out-of-parking-stamp with her. Blendle will pay for it.

Or just come by train, we?ll get you a fancy NS business card.

When you enter on your first day, it?s probably best to team up with your teammate/buddy and sit next to or near him or her. Just know that you?re free to sit anywhere you like. Just know that further to the back (behind the meeting rooms) we like to keep things quiet. Just to keep focus :). To improve focus we have one rule called the headphone-rule. Headphones on means ""do not disturb"". Pretty straight-forward, but it works.

Content: **Slack**

We use Slack for internal communication. This gives us all the ability to stalk each other,?se GIFs, work on Slack-bots, etc. etc. It comes as a web app, iOS app, Android App, OSX app and Windows app. Just download the apps for your platforms of choice. With [**this link](https://blendle.slack.com/signup)** you can create your own Slack account with your @blendle account (SSO for the win!). You can join all the relevant channels of your choice. Slack can also be a big distraction, so make sure to [**check out the do-not-disturb-functionalities](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/214908388-Do-Not-Disturb-and-snooze-settings).** If you run into any trouble, just let me know.

**Jira**

I?ve also sent you an invite (on your Blendle mail) for Jira. We use it for all sorts of things. Of course the occasional sprint planning but support uses it to flag issues and get them on sprints for example. Have a look around. When joining your team you?ll know soon enough which board to join.

    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.

    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.
    - You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.
    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.
- **Backdrop**
    
    The law and additional ruling tell us what we can and can not do according to time off. We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again.

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.

You can park your car [here](http://www.parkeren-utrecht.nl/parkeergarage-moreelsepark). Our Office Manager will get you a parking card asap (if you plan to come by car often). Until then, you can get a get-out-of-parking-stamp with her. Blendle will pay for it.

Or just come by train, we?ll get you a fancy NS business card.

When you enter on your first day, it?s probably best to team up with your teammate/buddy and sit next to or near him or her. Just know that you?re free to sit anywhere you like. Just know that further to the back (behind the meeting rooms) we like to keep things quiet. Just to keep focus :). To improve focus we have one rule called the headphone-rule. Headphones on means ""do not disturb"". Pretty straight-forward, but it works.

Content: # People System - Salarisbalie - Requesting Time off & Expensing

Salarisbalie is our payroll specialist and makes sure we get paid correctly every month, Salarisbalie works within a tool called NMBRS. NMBRS is used for saving and monitoring all personnel files,  personal information, holidays, dossiers, contracts, etc. 

When you start at Blendle, you get onboarded in this system. Easy peasy, everything in one place. 

You, HR and your lead have access to this self service tool.

So what can you do with Nmbrs?   Next to accessing your personal information and contracts, you can also change your contact information yourself. Plus, requesting time off and claiming expenses just became a whole lot easier: 

- **Time off request**
    
    **Why are we doing this if we have unlimited holidays?**
    The ""unlimited fair use"" rule stays. We are adding the balance for legal reasons. 
    
    And while we don't have a maximum, we do have a **minimum** that we want you to take, to keep you healthy - 20 days each year, for a 40 hour contract. 
    
    Plus, NMBRS has a super easy way to overview who is out of office and when, Blendle wide.  A great tool for teams and managers to plan work and availability especially around big projects or releases.
    
    **It looks weird in the system.....I see a negative balance!**

QUESTION: Is there a limit to how much I can spend on parties and celebrations?
=========
Content: # Party and study budget

There is money and time you can spend on celebrating stuff and for learning and development. We want you, as a Team Lead, to feel free to spend this money and time within these boundaries so you don't need permission every time you spend it on these two topics. We want to create clarity so you have the liberty?o spend money on this. We don't want to limit your thinking by coming up with a budget, so feel free to ask HR if you'd like to bend the budgets for a good reason.

You are in the lead for these two topics for your team. 

## Party budget

Apart from the Blendle-wide parties, outings and celebrations, we came up with a number for you to spend on team related stuff. **Every person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on fun stuff.** Why not ?80 or ?20? No good reason, we figured you could go out for dinner twice with your team for ?60. Every person keeps track of this for themselves.  

## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in.""

Content: ## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how. Does this fit in someones personal development path at Blendle? Does it match the personal goals? Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

A good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own. The rest is common sense.

As leads you can decide to say Yes or No to budget requests based on the above questions. If you need help deciding, you can discuss with HR.

**?0-?250** = no study contract. Like a cool book, online course or a ticket to a summit.

**?250-1500 =** 12 months study contract. Like a full blown study/course or a conference (abroad).

**?1500** = edge case with 24 months study contract, please discuss with HR.

QUESTION: What is the recommended amount of time off per year?
=========
Content: 'Time off' can be divided into two buckets:
    
    1. **Holidays and national holidays**:
        
        Your contract states you have 4 weeks of paid time off per year, by law.
        
        On average we have 8 national holidays per year. We have no CAO (collective employment agreement), which means you are not entitled to paid time off on every national holiday. We decided to follow the most common situation in an average company, which in practice means most people are off on the big national holidays. But that's your own choice, it's not a right or an obligation, so feel free to improvise. Some teams even have to (editorial and support, for example).
        
        These rules state that we are off on 'Bevrijdingsdag' once every 5 years. But we aren't allowed time off on Eid al-Fitr (Suikerfeest, ending of the Ramadan). That makes no sense to us. 
        
        So here is how we approach holidays and national holidays in practice.
        
        You 'have' 5 weeks holiday and ~8 national holidays per year. We want you to use this time off to reload but you decide when and how to consume this. You must also feel free to improvise. You work hard, maybe even a bit too hard, so you might need some extra time off to stay happy and healthy. This also works the other way around: maybe you had a chill quarter and feel no need to take a holiday: feel free to do so. We want you to think about what your body and mind needs instead of your quota.

Content: - **Take care of your body and mind**
    
    
    **Take holidays and days off.**
    
    This one seems obvious, but we know it?s not. We believe that working at Blendle is the Premier League, the creme de la creme :). That takes it?s toll and asks a lot from your body and mind. These two need time to recharge from your efforts. Make sure to build in moments of absolute rest during the year. It?s called a holiday. Make sure to take 4 weeks, and make sure at least 2 of those are in a row. Advice would be to really go away: studies show that this works best. There are some studies showing that taking regular holidays (every quarter) are very effective. So don?t wait 6 months to take 2 weeks. Also take a week every now and then.
    
    **Don?t work when you?re sick**
    
    When you have the flu, stay at home. Get back to work when you are fully recovered. Don?t feel guilty about it (easier said than done, we know). Yes we miss you, but we can do it without you for a few days. Even better: with you being away, your team might have to rethink how certain things are done in your absence. It can cause a new (maybe better) way for tasks and responsibilities to be distributed and single points of failure can be discovered and fixed.
    
    **Food and exercise**

Content: - We work hard, we need time to reload and rest. Sometimes we work harder, so we need more. Some times we work less, so we need less.
    - We have something called 'life' happening which means we can't work because we have more important stuff to do.
    
    We want you to take enough rest to reload and recharge so you can be at your prime when working. Taking enough rest is as important as giving it your all when working. The well known on and off switch.
    
    The concept of work isn't always caught in time (40 hours) and place. Most of the people at Blendle don't keep track of time because time is such a limited variable to grasp the concept of work. There is a balance to strike here and just looking at hours or a holiday quota limits this discussion. 
    
    **That is why we don't keep track of holidays.**
    
    Our people don't have a holiday quota, but a moral obligation to their loved ones and Blendle to work hard and take enough time to rest. Alright, sounds heavy. How does that work?

Content: # Taking Time off x

We kick off with the practical side of things and then dig into the idea behind it.

# Our time off policy

- Unlimited Vacation at Blendle
    - Time off is about the time you **need,** not about a **quota.**
    - At Blendle, **HR doesn't keep track** of your holidays **and we don't 'pay out' at the end of the ride.** When in doubt; less than 4 weeks is **not** enough, you may take more than that, just check with your lead if you're in doubt if it's reasonable.
    - **You can request for time off through Nmbrs** [https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/](https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/).   See People Systems section.       This way we have a handy overview of who is ooo and when. This helps when planning around bigger projects and releases etc. The overview is visible Blendle wide, cross teams. Don't worry if you end up with a negative balance, we top it up again in January! We like you to have at least 20 days off in a year. More can happen and is allowed. Here you can find more info on working with [Nmbrs](People%20System%20-%20Salarisbalie%20-%20Requesting%20Time%20off%20d436131e7b6840db95f13330ad7d3999.md)
    - You agree on your time off with your team(lead)
    - You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","There is no specific recommended amount of time off per year mentioned in the extracted parts of the document. However, the contract states that employees have 4 weeks of paid time off per year by law. Additionally, the company follows the commonly used national holidays, which amounts to approximately 8 days off per year. The company encourages employees to take enough rest to reload and recharge, and there is no holiday quota, but rather a moral obligation to work hard and take enough time to rest. The company values the concept of work-life balance and believes that time off should be based on individual needs rather than a set quota. Employees are encouraged to take holidays and days off to rest and recharge. It is recommended to take at least 4 weeks of holiday per year, with at least 2 weeks taken consecutively. Taking regular holidays, such as every quarter, is also considered effective. Ultimately, the decision on how much time off to take is left to the individual, with the understanding that rest and recharge are important for overall well-being.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

Content: - What does good performance and success look like for this person? What do you expect from him/her?
    - What challenges or downsides does this role have?
    - What would you call the role? Is it an existing role (if yes: think if you can use someone as a blueprint, if no: make sure to check if our job title matches with other companies).
    - How much experience do you think this person needs? What kind and type of experience? In what kind and type of environments? Do you expect this person to be plug and play or is there room for learning and growing?
    - What could someone's career path look like at Blendle? What do we have to offer there?
    - Do you expect this person to lead a team or guild in a way?
    - What would a average week look like for this person?
    - What are examples of projects that were there the last quarter which could have been done by the new hire? What projects or topics are coming up?
    - What kind of skills, knowledge, expertise or experience does this person need? Make a distinction between must-haves and nice-to-haves. Be specific.
    - What kind of skills are lacking in the current team which this new person should bring?
    - Selling points: why would someone quit his job for this role? Think about the team, the role and Blendle.

Content: 2. **Keep teams small.** More then 4-6 people creates more overhead (mainly communication like e-mail/slack and interactions in general) and doesn't necessarily mean that the team performs better. Jeff Bezos calls it the 2 pizza rule (you should be able to feed your team with 2 pizzas) and Ringelmann discovered 'social loafing' in 1914. People unintentionally slack when the group gets too big.

    3. **Keep budget in mind.** You should focus on getting the best team for the work you need done, but budget does play a role in this. People are our most important and most expensive resource. Hiring, therefore, is an expensive solution to a problem. 
    4. **Plan.** Discuss this step with your lead and HR.
        
        To be able to plan you need these variables: Team, Role, Profile and role description, Hitlist, Priority, Scarceness (1-5), Years of relevant experience, Salary range, Planning.

Content: - Someone's **role is no longer a match**. Roles, jobs and their demands change. They aren't static. Pay attention to changing roles and put effort into telling your people what changed instead of implicitly expecting people to understand what changed. A changing role can be a reason for someone to no longer be the perfect match. Tell someone what we expect from them, make it clear. Work together to match those new demands but be honest if it doesn't work.
        
        This also works the other way around: some roles don't change, but people do. 
        
    - Someone wants to **grow in a different direction**. Blendle is still a small company so we can't just offer every possible career path. Use 1 on 1's to talk about someone's ambition and career path. Be honest and realistic about the possibilities at Blendle. Think about whether you think someone would be a good fit for that role and tell them what would be needed to get to that point (in terms of skills, expertise, personality, experience). The next question is whether Blendle has a role like that vacant. Be realistic and open about this.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: Is there a study budget available at Blendle?
=========
Content: ## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how. Does this fit in someones personal development path at Blendle? Does it match the personal goals? Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

A good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own. The rest is common sense.

As leads you can decide to say Yes or No to budget requests based on the above questions. If you need help deciding, you can discuss with HR.

**?0-?250** = no study contract. Like a cool book, online course or a ticket to a summit.

**?250-1500 =** 12 months study contract. Like a full blown study/course or a conference (abroad).

**?1500** = edge case with 24 months study contract, please discuss with HR.

Content: # Party and study budget

There is money and time you can spend on celebrating stuff and for learning and development. We want you, as a Team Lead, to feel free to spend this money and time within these boundaries so you don't need permission every time you spend it on these two topics. We want to create clarity so you have the liberty?o spend money on this. We don't want to limit your thinking by coming up with a budget, so feel free to ask HR if you'd like to bend the budgets for a good reason.

You are in the lead for these two topics for your team. 

## Party budget

Apart from the Blendle-wide parties, outings and celebrations, we came up with a number for you to spend on team related stuff. **Every person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on fun stuff.** Why not ?80 or ?20? No good reason, we figured you could go out for dinner twice with your team for ?60. Every person keeps track of this for themselves.

    - **Week 1:** Make sure to **sit down with your lead** in the first few days to get to know each other and talk about expectations [and goals for the 1st month](http://goals.blendle.io/) and the 1st quarter (see below for a structure). Make sure to schedule your week 2 and week 4 check-ins.
    - **Week 2: Have a check-in** regarding expectations and goals. If there are doubts (from both sides): this is the time to say it. If there are severe doubts, think about scheduling another check-in next week (week 3).
    - **Week 4: Have a check-in** regarding expectations and goals. Your trial period ends and you wrap up your first month together. It's important to come up with a few personal goals in this talk. Think about feedback you got and things you would like to achieve, learn or do at Blendle. After this, you will receive continuous feedback and will be involved in the feedback cycle like everyone.

Content: ## **The conversation**

Try initiating an open conversation by scheduling a meet on the first day of return to work, or at least as soon as you can. The purpose behind this conversation is not to judge someone for being absent. But it's meant to uncover the factors behind, or the cause of the absence. There is a good chance that you or Blendle can prevent the next absence by talking about this.

**Explain why you are having this conversation**

- Don't ask right away about the problems and sickness. Make clear that it's about being absent.
- Share a list of dates and patterns relevant to being absent.
- Talk about how the absence worries you, how it effects the team and anyone close to the team member.

**How to and what questions to ask:**

[Google Slides - create and edit presentations online, for free.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11TAG83sZkoXBBGi8pIOVTnYq0fyR5SkzuQUDZN4bQUk/edit#slide=id.p17)

**Notes**

- Always ask open questions.
- Know your facts, this will prevent unnecessary discussions. You can ask HR for the statics.
- Let your team member steer you towards the right solutions, don't fill in the blanks.
- Take notes, set goals and share them with each other afterwards.
- Monitor the progress, have recurring conversations about the situation and the goals.
- There is a fine barrier between being too pushy and being truly engaged and it's normal to feel that dilemma. Just use your own judgement.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Content: - Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

Content: # Firing

Saying goodbye to Blendle (from a colleague) and to a colleague (from Blendle) is a very normal and natural thing. When done right, it can even be a beautiful thing. 

We advise you to read the backdrop below first, but feel free to jump in right away with the 'Here's what you can do'-section :). General note: you do not have to do this alone, so please ask for advice and help!

- **Backdrop**
    
    Saying goodbye to Blendle (from a colleague) and to a colleague (from Blendle) is a very normal and natural thing. When done right, it can even be a beautiful thing.
    
    Saying goodbye to people is also an important part of keeping your team on the right track. Firing can even be a part of your [Personnel Planning](Hiring%20fd6a5e1f88dd4476988147a3a62e1f0d.md). The most common situation will be when you think someone is no longer a good match with Blendle for whatever reason. This doesn't happen overnight, so try to spot situations where this is happening. 
    
    To make things clear: HR and Rick and Alex will help you with this, but we want this to be on your agenda. HR will take care of the process and paper- and legal work. Rick and Alex will help with the tough conversations. **The most important work happens months before that and that's where you come in.**
    
    Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :).

Content: 2. **Life events:** 
        
        Life happens. Your cat dies, your car broke, you move to another city, you get married or have kids. Life events which all need your attention. We decided that we are not going to decide for you how much time you **get** for certain events. The question is: how much time do you actually **need.** 
        
        Most companies don't give you time off for funerals that are not for immediate relatives. We think we don't need a rule to tell us if that funeral is important for you. So take the time you need.
        
    
- Edge cases
    - Sabbatical: check with HR if you for example have plans to take a very long trip (longer then ~4 weeks).

QUESTION: What is the process for escalating an issue or concern?
=========
Content: # Addressing harassment

You are *always* in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward when you report an incident. We encourage you to talk about what happened.

If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8). In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it?s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. 

Here are the steps you can take, either:

- **Talk to the offender**. If you suspect that an offender doesn?t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.

Content: ## **What you can expect from HR**

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.

Content: 'Time off' can be divided into two buckets:
    
    1. **Holidays and national holidays**:
        
        Your contract states you have 4 weeks of paid time off per year, by law.
        
        On average we have 8 national holidays per year. We have no CAO (collective employment agreement), which means you are not entitled to paid time off on every national holiday. We decided to follow the most common situation in an average company, which in practice means most people are off on the big national holidays. But that's your own choice, it's not a right or an obligation, so feel free to improvise. Some teams even have to (editorial and support, for example).
        
        These rules state that we are off on 'Bevrijdingsdag' once every 5 years. But we aren't allowed time off on Eid al-Fitr (Suikerfeest, ending of the Ramadan). That makes no sense to us. 
        
        So here is how we approach holidays and national holidays in practice.
        
        You 'have' 5 weeks holiday and ~8 national holidays per year. We want you to use this time off to reload but you decide when and how to consume this. You must also feel free to improvise. You work hard, maybe even a bit too hard, so you might need some extra time off to stay happy and healthy. This also works the other way around: maybe you had a chill quarter and feel no need to take a holiday: feel free to do so. We want you to think about what your body and mind needs instead of your quota.

Content: - We work hard, we need time to reload and rest. Sometimes we work harder, so we need more. Some times we work less, so we need less.
    - We have something called 'life' happening which means we can't work because we have more important stuff to do.
    
    We want you to take enough rest to reload and recharge so you can be at your prime when working. Taking enough rest is as important as giving it your all when working. The well known on and off switch.
    
    The concept of work isn't always caught in time (40 hours) and place. Most of the people at Blendle don't keep track of time because time is such a limited variable to grasp the concept of work. There is a balance to strike here and just looking at hours or a holiday quota limits this discussion. 
    
    **That is why we don't keep track of holidays.**
    
    Our people don't have a holiday quota, but a moral obligation to their loved ones and Blendle to work hard and take enough time to rest. Alright, sounds heavy. How does that work?

Content: **Official Holidays and Vacay!**

Of course, we ain?t all workaholics, but we don?t have any CAO (collective employment agreement) with loads of bylaws. But we do have some official holidays. Be sure to check them out in the Handbook. If you want to head out to enjoy your well-deserved vacation then there is only 1 rule, and 1 rule to rule them all: check/discuss with your team and team lead.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

        These rules state that we are off on 'Bevrijdingsdag' once every 5 years. But we aren't allowed time off on Eid al-Fitr (Suikerfeest, ending of the Ramadan). That makes no sense to us. 
        
        So here is how we approach holidays and national holidays in practice.
        
        You 'have' 5 weeks holiday and ~8 national holidays per year. We want you to use this time off to reload but you decide when and how to consume this. You must also feel free to improvise. You work hard, maybe even a bit too hard, so you might need some extra time off to stay happy and healthy. This also works the other way around: maybe you had a chill quarter and feel no need to take a holiday: feel free to do so. We want you to think about what your body and mind needs instead of your quota.

Content: 3. Within 4 weeks after birth:
        - Inform HR of the birth date
        - Let your lead and HR know if you need anything when you are back at work
    
- **Birth leave**
    
    As a partner (if you are not the one giving birth) you are also entitled to leave after the birth of your child. The official term for this is birth leave. By law you can take 6 week off to enjoy your new offspring and help your partner (within the first 6 months after birth). During these 6 **weeks** you get your full salary paid. Just make sure you and your lead have made arrangements about the continuity of the ongoing projects/work within your team during your absence. And inform the hr@blendle.com of the dates for UWV and legal reasons. 
    
    Again, please let us know if you and your partner encounter unexpected complications. We?ll do our best to help where we can.
    
- **Parental leave**
    
    As a parent (both parents) you are also entitled to parental leave for every child. In total, you can have **26 x your weekly work hours** off per child. If you work 40 hours a week, it would be 1040 hours total parental leave for each child.  So this right applies to each child separately and you can make use of it until a child is 8 years old. You can choose to take time off either for a longer period at once, or spread it. For example 1 day per week off.

Content: # Parenthood

Being or becoming a parent can be challenging at home and at work. No matter if you are already a parent or are going to be one, you might have some questions about what Blendle has in place for Blendle moms and dads. This page should contain all the information you seek.j

- **Maternity leave**
    
    When you're pregnant, we recommend you inform your lead and HR no later than 3 months before your due date. This way we have enough time for the necessary paperwork with UWV. We also need a pregnancy statement from your doctor with the due date.
    
    **Some practical info:**
    
    1. Absence during pregnancy:
        
        If you happen to get ill because of your pregnancy or if you have to be absent because of doctor appointments, please inform your lead. Our general guidelines on [Holidays](Holidays%20x%205b552479e5ad40b49ce71fa68840ce35.md) and [Sickness](Sickness%20absence%204ee2e3c7281546d3a827de3e3e286366.md) absence also apply in this case.
        
    2. Salary:
        
        Nothing changes here. Blendle pays your full salary.
        
    3. Duration of maternity leave:

Content: - When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.
- When people work hard, **poke them** to take time off so they recharge.
- For longer leaves of absence (~4 weeks) ping HR for advice.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

We use Slack for internal communication.

With [**this link](https://blendle.slack.com/signup)** you can create your own Slack account with your @blendle account (SSO for the win!). You can join all the relevant channels of your choice.

**Jira**

I?ve also sent you an invite (on your Blendle mail) for Jira. We use it for all sorts of things. Of course the occasional sprint planning but support uses it to flag issues and get them on sprints for example. Have a look around. When joining your team you?ll know soon enough which board to join.

We expect you to foster a well-organised, respectful and collaborative environment. You should avoid offending, participating in heated altercations and disrupting our workplace. We will not tolerate anyone intimidating, pestering, humiliating, victimizing or sabotaging others at Blendle. We also prohibit wilful discrimination based on age, sexual orientation, gender, ethnicity, race, religion or disability. This is by no means an exhaustive list but it gives an indication, use your common sense. You should also conform to [our inclusion and diversity policy](Diversity%20and%20Inclusion%20b8d3907631944696a4e76c2a41e757a5.md) in all aspects of your work, from recruitment and performance reviews to interpersonal relations.

Content: Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behavior is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn?t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions.

If you suspect that someone doesn?t realize their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when:

- Your lead, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

    - **Week 2: Have a check-in** regarding expectations and goals. If there are doubts (from both sides): this is the time to say it. If there are severe doubts, think about scheduling another check-in next week (week 3).
    - **Week 4: Have a check-in** regarding expectations and goals. Your trial period ends and you wrap up your first month together. It's important to come up with a few personal goals in this talk. Think about feedback you got and things you would like to achieve, learn or do at Blendle. After this, you will receive continuous feedback and will be involved in the feedback cycle like everyone. This is also a good moment to schedule your weekly or bi-weekly 1on1's with your lead.

Content: - **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?
    
    Are you giving praise?
    
    Are you actively challenging your team?
    
    Are you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?
    
    Are you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: Does Blendle track diversity data within the company?
=========
Content: - We believe being **inclusive** is important because it **fits our core values** of wanting to be a great place to work and really caring for each other. A place where people feel welcome and can be themselves. Inclusivity is crucial to our work environment and culture.
- We have trouble hiring diverse profiles. We noticed no flaws in the hiring process which would lead to favour a certain type of profile. We did notice that the 'pools' in which we are hiring (journalism and tech) are dominated by a certain profile which could explain this trend.
- We have open-minded people at Blendle who are willing and are becoming more aware.

**Some observations**:

- We tend to speak in Dutch in social settings. It can easily make non-Dutch people uncomfortable. We should speak English.
- The way we work (especially in meetings) suits extravert people better then introvert people.
- There is not a lot of variation on standard diversity variables like political views, religion, age, ethnicity, gender and educational background. Again, partly explained by the field we're in.
- Most of the leaders at Blendle are male.
- There is equal pay between men and women in the same role.
- We believe aiming for diversity numbers narrows the conversation on the topic for now. We decided to use the data to feed the conversation but not implement quotas.

**What we do:**

Content: # Diversity and Inclusion

It was this ^^ picture from our Christmas party three years ago which got us some replies on Twitter. A lot of males and a lot of white. We know that we need to do better to make Blendle a more diverse workplace. We spend a lot of time thinking about diversity and inclusion. After reading, talking and listening, we learned a few things:

- This is a sensitive topic: feelings and opinions are involved.
- This is a trending topic: there is a lot of noise and it's hard to pin down the essence.
- This is not a new, but renewed topic.
- Diversity and inclusion is more of a scale than a simple yes or no statement.
- Everyone is biased and every company is at risk of becoming less diverse and inclusive.
- A more diverse and inclusive company **>** a less diverse and inclusive company for a lot of reasons.
- Diversity and inclusion is not 'just' about gender or race, so looking at just those numbers can limit your thoughts on this topic. The practical side of this topic is also way more subtle.

**Diversity and inclusion at Blendle**

What we know now:

- We believe in the importance of a **diverse** team because we believe **it's crucial to our succes and product.** We try to add meaning to peoples everyday life by helping them reach quality content instead of cat gifs on Facebook. This can only be done by a group of people with different backgrounds, expertise, personalities, talents, ideas and opinions.

=========
Content: - Address it if you feel morale is fading. It can be a red flag. Is it one person? One situation? One team? One project? Or is it more?
    
- **Culture**
    
    Lead by example when it comes to culture. We tried pinning down our DNA by writing down our operating principles but we came to the conclusion it's essentially all about you. The people themselves are the culture and we guard that culture. What you stand for, what you believe in and how we treat each other is part of our DNA. So be yourself and keep expressing yourself to your team. 'This is not how we do things' is a totally fine comment. Don't forget to explain why though :).

    The people around you are probably one of the reasons you like working at Blendle. We are not robots, so relate to your team. As a lead, it's good to **invest in personal relationships**. This will help you in so many ways.

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.

Officer Rivera was 22.

QUESTION: Are there any observations regarding the current diversity at Blendle?
=========
Content: - We believe being **inclusive** is important because it **fits our core values** of wanting to be a great place to work and really caring for each other. A place where people feel welcome and can be themselves. Inclusivity is crucial to our work environment and culture.
- We have trouble hiring diverse profiles. We noticed no flaws in the hiring process which would lead to favour a certain type of profile. We did notice that the 'pools' in which we are hiring (journalism and tech) are dominated by a certain profile which could explain this trend.
- We have open-minded people at Blendle who are willing and are becoming more aware.

**Some observations**:

- We tend to speak in Dutch in social settings. It can easily make non-Dutch people uncomfortable. We should speak English.
- The way we work (especially in meetings) suits extravert people better then introvert people.
- There is not a lot of variation on standard diversity variables like political views, religion, age, ethnicity, gender and educational background. Again, partly explained by the field we're in.
- Most of the leaders at Blendle are male.
- There is equal pay between men and women in the same role.
- We believe aiming for diversity numbers narrows the conversation on the topic for now. We decided to use the data to feed the conversation but not implement quotas.

**What we do:**

Content: # Diversity and Inclusion

It was this ^^ picture from our Christmas party three years ago which got us some replies on Twitter. A lot of males and a lot of white. We know that we need to do better to make Blendle a more diverse workplace. We spend a lot of time thinking about diversity and inclusion. After reading, talking and listening, we learned a few things:

- This is a sensitive topic: feelings and opinions are involved.
- This is a trending topic: there is a lot of noise and it's hard to pin down the essence.
- This is not a new, but renewed topic.
- Diversity and inclusion is more of a scale than a simple yes or no statement.
- Everyone is biased and every company is at risk of becoming less diverse and inclusive.
- A more diverse and inclusive company **>** a less diverse and inclusive company for a lot of reasons.
- Diversity and inclusion is not 'just' about gender or race, so looking at just those numbers can limit your thoughts on this topic. The practical side of this topic is also way more subtle.

**Diversity and inclusion at Blendle**

What we know now:

- We believe in the importance of a **diverse** team because we believe **it's crucial to our succes and product.** We try to add meaning to peoples everyday life by helping them reach quality content instead of cat gifs on Facebook. This can only be done by a group of people with different backgrounds, expertise, personalities, talents, ideas and opinions.

Your team members will sometimes not be present ?. No worries, they are just taking time off or recovering. Here's what you can do. 

**Holidays: time off ??**

If you haven't please take a look at the section about time off for everyone: 

[Taking Time off x](Taking%20Time%20off%20x%2000c8b7bcab1a4b1ba5d285adb774b32d.md)

- Your team will put a request in for time off through Nmbrs. Nmbrs will inform you through email, you can accept or decline this request by clicking the link in the email.

[People System - Salarisbalie - Requesting Time off & Expensing](People%20System%20-%20Salarisbalie%20-%20Requesting%20Time%20off%20d436131e7b6840db95f13330ad7d3999.md)

- We only track this to have a handy overview of who is off and when, for example for planning around projects and releases.
- Keep in mind we don't pay out holidays at the end of the ride.
- Make sure people take enough time off (4-6 weeks per year) by bringing it up every once in a while. But: **it's their responsibility.**
- Make sure people **communicate** their time off well with the team and you. You have a say in this and you have to agree on someones time off (which will be fine in 99% of cases).
- Make sure your people put it in the **@all and their own agenda.**
- When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

- Don?t save all your feedback up - give at the time of the event (or shortly after) -  There should be no surprises
- Don't make it personal.  Focus on the situation not the person. and how you can work together to improve it for next time.
- Examples are fine, but don't use them for the blame game.
- Reflect on your intention in giving someone your feedback. Are you giving it to help someone or to shame someone?  Did you have a role in the situation that happened?
- Be clear and direct, subtle gibberish doesn't help anyone.
- Remember A-P-P-R-E-C-I-A-T-I-O-N helps motivate and shows people their unique value.

<aside>
? Tips for r**eceiving feedback**

</aside>

- Always assume feedback is given to help you
- Be open to listening and don't get stuck in a spiral of defending or pointing fingers back.
Take responsibility if something went wrong and focus on learning how to work together better.
- Be curious - Why is this feedback given to you? What is really at the root of it?  Is it the feedback itself that indicates a problem or is some emotion underlying it that needs to be addressed?

Content: - **Continuous Feedback**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Don?t save up feedback, it?s less powerful. Just speak your mind. The more often you do this, the easier it gets. This goes both ways: good and bad. I never heard someone say he or she got too much feedback.
    
    **How?** 
    
    Face to face is best (e-mail/slack/chat is ok for practical stuff).
    
    Praise in public, feedback 1on1.
    
    Think about:
    
    - quality of work: you did well on X. Because ABC.
    - way of working: you were slow and distracted, how can I help?
    - behaviour: try not to interrupt people during the meeting.
    
    There are a lot of tips out there on how to give feedback.
    
    I like the HIP-approach:
    
    - **H**umble
    - **H**elpful
    - **I**mmediate
    - **I**n person
    - **P**rivate criticism/ **P**ublic Praise
    - Not about **P**ersonality
    
    Source:
    
    [A HIP Approach to Feedback | Achieve Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/a-hip-approach-to-feedback/)
    
- **Have scheduled (bi-)weekly 1on1's**
    
    **Why?**
    
    It?s important and it's not going to happen if you don?t schedule it. If all is fine it might feel too much. It isn?t. Goal is to ?stay in touch? and simply have a relationship with someone. The relationship is the basis for being able to give good feedback and it makes it easier to receive too.
    
    **How?**

Content: # Leading Feedback

We can not stress enough how we value feedback in all its forms.?*Good feedback is at the center of all people-related topics**. Good feedback is the key to a good collaboration, happy people and even a successful company. As a lead, you are responsible for leading the feedback for your people. This section will help you do so. Look at this list as a toolkit for you and your colleagues. 

[Our Feedback Process](Our%20Feedback%20Process%20c40fc80d546045ffb7076797301e81a8.md)

- **Make notes**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Well, because you forget. Plus making notes forces you to constantly think about the feedback. We would recommend making it a habit at the end of the week (weekly review ftw!): how did X do? 
    
    If you have a good system, it will also allow you to look back. ?Didn?t we discuss this already a year ago? It?s still an issue?. It also shows that you don?t forget and take this seriously.
    
    **How?**
    
    Docs, Evernote, Todoist, Wunderlist, Word, Things or even a notebook (I would not recommend a notebook). Whatever works. Just make small notes: You did well on project X and meeting Y, because ABC. I really liked when you did X, because it had an effect on ABC. It helps you during the reviews every 6 months.

Just know that further to the back (behind the meeting rooms) we like to keep things quiet. Just to keep focus :). To improve focus we have one rule called the headphone-rule. Headphones on means ""do not disturb"". Pretty straight-forward, but it works.

More practical information about our office and door lock can be found [**here](General%20&%20practical%20b2682126db8e47bf8e5fabb8b5b4c1ce.md)**

**Massage**

Every week on Wednesday from 12.30-16.00h (might change, see the all@ calendar), we have a masseuse come by to relieve us from stress (what stress), RSI, that aching back or tiredness. And yes its great! There is no queue, just a free-for-all.

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?le is in charge of lunch ??sk her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

**Snacks and more**

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

=========
Content: # Learning Budget

There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely.  Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? 

Does Blendle benefit from the fact that you are spending time and money on learning and development? 

Does this fit in your personal development path at Blendle? 

Does it match personal goals? 

Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

Would you spend the money on this if it was your own?

**Talk to your Lead, and they will help decide with finance for learning budget requests.**

Content: How does that look? Sometimes it?s better to skip a morning stand-up to visit a physio for your constant headache. You are acting in Blendle?s interest when doing this.
    
- **Check your work, job and role**
    
    
    Are you doing the right job? Do you get energy from what you are doing? Do you feel like you?re making a difference? Do you love most of it? Of course there will be stuff you don?t like, that?s totally normal. But are you doing things you are good at and you like? And is there enough challenge, perspective and room to grow?
    
    Are you getting enough praise and feedback? Do you know what is expected from you? Do you know how you are doing at the moment?
    
    It?s really important that you know how your team and team leads think you are doing. Ask them! What are you doing well, what needs to improve. Use the structure we came up with: 1on1?s, personal goals, feedback sessions, peer reviews. But feel free to alter them in order for them to work for you. Just don?t do nothing.
    
- **Last but not least: get informed.**
    
    There is a lot of information out there. Inform yourself. It will help you recognize a potential threat earlier and help you act on that.

    Yes, as we now know there is a lot more to it than just taking holidays and working less. You could still feel stressed working 20 hours. Looking at the time spent on work and time spent on your personal life is a pretty good start and good for everybody (also when you don?t feel stressed. Let?s try to prevent it).

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Content: # Addressing harassment

You are *always* in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward when you report an incident. We encourage you to talk about what happened.

If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8). In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it?s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. 

Here are the steps you can take, either:

- **Talk to the offender**. If you suspect that an offender doesn?t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.

Content: # Office

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?le is in charge of lunch ??sk her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

**Snacks and more**

Content: When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:
    
    - **It is impossible to work 60 hours productively over a longer period of time.** It hurts you and Blendle to work that much. If you are able to work 8 productive hours a day you should be proud of that. Sometimes it will be 6, sometimes 10: relax, it?s okay, You?re not working in a factory with time stamps.
    - Be flexible. Some days you just don?t have it. **You are not a machine.** Of course, first you?ll take a walk and grab a double espresso or a Club Mate, but if that doesn?t work it?s okay. Go home. Go to the gym. Go play with your kid. Go kiting. Go for a walk in the forest. Anything, just don?t sit behind your desk to ?make the hours?. That?s not helping anybody.
    - Working at home vs. at Blendle HQ. Try to strike a **balance between home/office**. Meetings and brainstorms are best done face to face but a day of deep work is best done in a cafe or on an abandoned island with 4g.
    - **Rotate, change your pace.** During the summer it can be nice to start at 6:30 and bike to the beach at 15.00h. During the winter, every morning might feel like a small hangover and you stroll into HQ at 10:00 after your first 2 cups of coffee.
- **Take care of your body and mind**
    
    
    **Take holidays and days off.**

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: What are the key values emphasized in Blendle's feedback process?
=========
Content: - **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?
    
    Are you giving praise?
    
    Are you actively challenging your team?
    
    Are you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?
    
    Are you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?
    
    Is your schedule (and that of your team) in a healthy rhythm (work-life balance)? You set the example.
    
    Is your team taking regular holidays/long weekends?
    
    Here?s an article about how to help your team with this:

- Don?t save all your feedback up - give at the time of the event (or shortly after) -  There should be no surprises
- Don't make it personal.  Focus on the situation not the person. and how you can work together to improve it for next time.
- Examples are fine, but don't use them for the blame game.
- Reflect on your intention in giving someone your feedback. Are you giving it to help someone or to shame someone?  Did you have a role in the situation that happened?
- Be clear and direct, subtle gibberish doesn't help anyone.
- Remember A-P-P-R-E-C-I-A-T-I-O-N helps motivate and shows people their unique value.

? Tips for r**eceiving feedback**

</aside>

- Always assume feedback is given to help you
- Be open to listening and don't get stuck in a spiral of defending or pointing fingers back.
Take responsibility if something went wrong and focus on learning how to work together better.
- Be curious - Why is this feedback given to you? What is really at the root of it?  Is it the feedback itself that indicates a problem or is some emotion underlying it that needs to be addressed?

Content: # Blendle value's

Putting our set of values or our way of life in writing wasn't an easy task. Mainly because the moment we started putting this in writing, it already altered. We started with a set of Blendle peeps writing down every word that came to mind when thinking about Blendle. We made categories and tried making sentences out of it. We shared that with the whole group, got some good feedback and slimmed it down to 5 powerful value's.

Content: # Our Feedback Process

> At Blendle we value the **Freedom** and **Responsibility** of giving **Proactive** and **Honest** feedback to drive excellent **Team Work**.   We try to build input points into everything we do.  We even got feedback on upgrading our Feedback process - all of which is incorporated into the new process below.
> 

# **Typical Feedback Moments @ Blendle:**

- **Sprint retro** - every 2 weeks.  How did the cycle go?  What did we learn? How did we feel?
- **Agile Process retro** - Monthly.  How can we improve the process and collaboration?
- **BIG HR People Surve**y - two times a year Q1 and Q4 on Employee experience.
- **EVERYDAY!**

# The **Quarterly Coaching Feedback Process**

At least every Quarter we want to make sure you get a formal feedback and coaching conversation focused on your personal and professional development, and progress.  And luckily, the quarterly process aligns to the timing of our Objectives Goals Strategies Measures, so you can chat about both with your manager at the same time.

### The Process:

**YOU** run ***your*** process - End to End.  By having full ownership you control your development (that ****responsible** value again ?) and focus on **teamwork** **and ****honesty ****by discussing feedback together (rather than through your manager).  So you're developing from the development process itself!

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror.

QUESTION: How does Blendle fight bias in the hiring process?
=========
Content: - We believe being **inclusive** is important because it **fits our core values** of wanting to be a great place to work and really caring for each other. A place where people feel welcome and can be themselves. Inclusivity is crucial to our work environment and culture.
- We have trouble hiring diverse profiles. We noticed no flaws in the hiring process which would lead to favour a certain type of profile. We did notice that the 'pools' in which we are hiring (journalism and tech) are dominated by a certain profile which could explain this trend.
- We have open-minded people at Blendle who are willing and are becoming more aware.

**Some observations**:

- We tend to speak in Dutch in social settings. It can easily make non-Dutch people uncomfortable. We should speak English.
- The way we work (especially in meetings) suits extravert people better then introvert people.
- There is not a lot of variation on standard diversity variables like political views, religion, age, ethnicity, gender and educational background. Again, partly explained by the field we're in.
- Most of the leaders at Blendle are male.
- There is equal pay between men and women in the same role.
- We believe aiming for diversity numbers narrows the conversation on the topic for now. We decided to use the data to feed the conversation but not implement quotas.

**What we do:**

Content: # What can Blendle do?

There?s a lot Blendle could improve and we?re working on that. The fact that we are a fast-paced startup with an aim to save journalism is not something that will change any time soon. This also means that we are facing a runway, which affects our everyday work. This is fuelling us to go the extra mile, but the downsides are also obvious.

So what can Blendle do?

- **Voicing vision & mission more:** everybody should feel connected to where Blendle is going and why. Talking about this more will help everybody align. This way everybody has more influence on the direction and it is more clear why a change of direction is made and how this affects your work.
- Open channels: **work on transparency and trust**: everybody should be able to speak up if they feel that the stress level is too high. Also when someone feels like they aren?t in the right role or simply doing work they don?t love everyday.
- **Build an environment which is less stressful.** This piece is step 1 on this point. Notice when people work too much. Tell people if we notice it and tell them to take action (go home, take holiday, work less, talk to someone). Let?s also keep improving the process we have in place for when people feel it?s too much.

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","Blendle fights bias in the hiring process by promoting inclusivity and creating a work environment where people feel welcome and can be themselves. They acknowledge the lack of diversity in certain fields and are working on hiring more diverse profiles. They also aim to raise awareness about unconscious bias and have open-minded employees who are becoming more aware. They believe in using data to feed the conversation about diversity but do not implement quotas. They are actively working on improving their hiring process to be more inclusive.

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people.

Content: # Your 1st month

Hey you! Welcome to Blendle. Buckle up, you're in for one hell of a ride :). 

The faster you get settled in the better, so we came up with a structure for your first month to make sure you have a smooth start.

- **Structure 1st month**
    
    Your first month is officially your trial period, which means both parties can terminate the contract if we figure out it is a total mismatch. In Blendle history, this happened once. Your first month is **not** an extended hiring process. As you might have noticed, the hiring process was pretty thorough and you made it through. This means we are pretty sure this is a good match. But, life happens so it's good to have a safeguard like the trial period, just don't feel any extra pressure plz.
    
    - **Before day 1:** your contract is signed and all the administrative stuff is taken care of. After that you got your on-boarding e-mail which probably led you here. This e-mail contains all the basic knowledge and acces codes to get you going.
    - **Day 1:** **Start** around 10:00 (depending on your team, check with them), receive your laptop and Blendle stuff, get settled in (where is the toilet, how does the coffee machine work). Your buddy will get you started in terms of work.

Content: - **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?
    
    Are you giving praise?
    
    Are you actively challenging your team?
    
    Are you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?
    
    Are you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?
    
    Is your schedule (and that of your team) in a healthy rhythm (work-life balance)? You set the example.
    
    Is your team taking regular holidays/long weekends?

    Give your new hires a smooth start. Here's how.

    - **Confirm your hire**. The first/two month(s) is the trial period. This is not an extended hiring process, but make sure to validate your hire from both sides. If there are any doubts, flag it with your lead or HR and consider building in more check-ins.

Content: # Addressing harassment

You are *always* in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward when you report an incident. We encourage you to talk about what happened.

If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8). In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it?s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. 

Here are the steps you can take, either:

- **Talk to the offender**. If you suspect that an offender doesn?t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.

Content: - When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.
- When people work hard, **poke them** to take time off so they recharge.
- For longer leaves of absence (~4 weeks) ping HR for advice.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Entrance code: [here](https://www.notion.so/8354943cbce846e086ad48e67dc153bc)

You can park your car [here](http://www.parkeren-utrecht.nl/parkeergarage-moreelsepark). Our Office Manager will get you a parking card asap (if you plan to come by car often). Until then, you can get a get-out-of-parking-stamp with her. Blendle will pay for it.

Or just come by train, we?ll get you a fancy NS business card.

When you enter on your first day, it?s probably best to team up with your teammate/buddy and sit next to or near him or her. Just know that you?re free to sit anywhere you like. Just know that further to the back (behind the meeting rooms) we like to keep things quiet. Just to keep focus :). To improve focus we have one rule called the headphone-rule. Headphones on means ""do not disturb"". Pretty straight-forward, but it works.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

We use Slack for internal communication.

With [**this link](https://blendle.slack.com/signup)** you can create your own Slack account with your @blendle account (SSO for the win!). You can join all the relevant channels of your choice. Slack can also be a big distraction, so make sure to [**check out the do-not-disturb-functionalities](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/214908388-Do-Not-Disturb-and-snooze-settings).** If you run into any trouble, just let me know.

I?ve also sent you an invite (on your Blendle mail) for Jira. We use it for all sorts of things. Of course the occasional sprint planning but support uses it to flag issues and get them on sprints for example. Have a look around. When joining your team you?ll know soon enough which board to join.

You can park your car [here](http://www.parkeren-utrecht.nl/parkeergarage-moreelsepark). Our Office Manager will get you a parking card asap (if you plan to come by car often). Until then, you can get a get-out-of-parking-stamp with her. Blendle will pay for it.

Or just come by train, we?ll get you a fancy NS business card.

When you enter on your first day, it?s probably best to team up with your teammate/buddy and sit next to or near him or her. Just know that you?re free to sit anywhere you like. Just know that further to the back (behind the meeting rooms) we like to keep things quiet. Just to keep focus :). To improve focus we have one rule called the headphone-rule. Headphones on means ""do not disturb"". Pretty straight-forward, but it works.

    UPDATE 2019: Please also check ??
    
    Alright, so you came to the conclusion you need to hire someone. The next step is to pin down what you are (and aren't) exactly looking for in a candidate. This step is crucial. Rush this and you'll find yourself wobbling further down the road. 
    
    *Ask for help from recruitment/HR with this. They can help you out.*
    
    This set of questions should help you define your perfect candidate.
    
    - What team will the new person be joining? What is the goal of that team and how does that new person's job fit in there?
    - What problems are we aiming to solve by hiring this person? What would it look like when the problem is solved?
    - What impact do we expect this person to make in his/her - let's say - first 6 months?
    - What does good performance and success look like for this person? What do you expect from him/her?
    - What challenges or downsides does this role have?

Content: # Hiring

Getting new people to join Blendle is a **high effort, high impact** thing to do. The reward is huge, when you see the people you hired adding value to the company. Imagine not hiring that person: that new idea, design, piece of code, algorithm or audio show would not have been there. Your hire could be key to the succes of Blendle: that's a lot of impact. The other side of the same coin is that it's high effort too. These 4 pointers will help you get started. 

- **Personnel planning**
    
    Planning the number and type of people you need in the future is hard but also crucial. Hiring people takes time (~3 months), so looking ahead is important for making your projects succeed. Without the right (number of) people, it's hard to build a cool product.
    
    When making plans for **the coming and next quarter:**
    
    1. **Determine what work needs to be done, looking 6-12 months ahead, and decide if we have enough resources to do so.** 
        
        Our basic premise is that we work with the team we have and we hire reactively. But ask yourself a few questions. Do you have the right number and type of people? What kind of skills, expertise, experience do you need in what amount? What can we fix internally? What can we teach the people who are at Blendle? What can we just try with advice from outside?

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: What retirement plans does the company offer?
=========
Content: - **Telephone costs/reimbursements:** if you need to make a lot of phone calls for Blendle, we?ll reimburse your costs. Same goes for other costs.
        - **Pension:** we facilitate pensions via [Bright Pensioen](https://brightpensioen.nl/). Bright is not your standard pension plan. We think it?s better than the mandatory corporate pension scheme which you might be used to. [This video](https://youtu.be/xfZM2JuovJM?t=1941) explains a bit about pensions in general and it starts at the point where they explain what Bright Pensioen is and why we chose it. At the moment Blendle can?t afford a full blown pension plan, but we want to do what we can. That?s why Blendle pays the costs to Bright, so the money you put aside, goes straight to your pension. I also attached a presentation Bright did at Blendle.
        - **Option plan:** there is an Option plan. Options are worth a lot for us, because it is the most precious thing we have: a part of our company. So we don?t hand them out by default, we just want you to know it?s there and that we can explain the details to you later if you want.
        - **Laptop:** a good laptop is important, so you get one from us. Special needs? Let me know.
        - **Equipment:** we have electric sit-stand-desks and good chairs so your back stays in shape and there are more than enough screens and additional equipment at the office.
        - **Massages:** once a week, our masseuse gets rid of all our stress with her chair massages.

QUESTION: What is the process for requesting a raise?
=========
Content: - **Off cycle salary increases**
    
    **Contract renewal** is not a moment that automatically means it is time to talk about money. We are not a company of people who demand *""give me X or I walk''*.  
    
    People can bring up salary any moment they want and we take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high) - see ""**How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?""**
    
    **Good reasons to raise offcycle**
    
    - Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.
    - Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone's impact and capabilities. It's important to be able to quantify that curve.
    - New information internally or externally.
    - New information by benchmarking studies or during hiring.
    
    **Not so good reasons to give a raise**
    
    - Colleague got another offer and uses this to get a raise.
    - 'I earn X for this company, that's a lot of money, I want a piece of the pie'.
    - Colleague just wants an incentive to stay. Money is never the answer, because it will fade - very - fast.
- **Control questions**
    
    Now before you finally decide
    
    - If we had to hire someone today for X's job, what would we pay them?
    - What would it cost Blendle as a business to find a new person (hard to replace, scarcity, time to hire, impact on day to day business & product)?

FINAL ANSWER:","The process for requesting a raise at Blendle is as follows:
1. Employees can bring up salary concerns at any time.
2. Good reasons for requesting a raise include drastic changes in role and responsibilities, a steep learning curve that makes current pay unfair, new information internally or externally, and new information from benchmarking studies or during hiring.
3. Not-so-good reasons for giving a raise include a colleague getting another offer and using it to negotiate a raise, demanding a raise based on what others earn, and requesting a raise as an incentive to stay.
4. Before making a decision on a raise, consider the cost to the company of finding a new person for the role and the impact on the salary structure.

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

QUESTION: What positions should I focus on hiring in the first month?
=========
Content: # Hiring

Getting new people to join Blendle is a **high effort, high impact** thing to do. The reward is huge, when you see the people you hired adding value to the company. Imagine not hiring that person: that new idea, design, piece of code, algorithm or audio show would not have been there. Your hire could be key to the succes of Blendle: that's a lot of impact. The other side of the same coin is that it's high effort too. These 4 pointers will help you get started. 

- **Personnel planning**
    
    Planning the number and type of people you need in the future is hard but also crucial. Hiring people takes time (~3 months), so looking ahead is important for making your projects succeed. Without the right (number of) people, it's hard to build a cool product.
    
    When making plans for **the coming and next quarter:**
    
    1. **Determine what work needs to be done, looking 6-12 months ahead, and decide if we have enough resources to do so.** 
        
        Our basic premise is that we work with the team we have and we hire reactively. But ask yourself a few questions. Do you have the right number and type of people? What kind of skills, expertise, experience do you need in what amount? What can we fix internally? What can we teach the people who are at Blendle? What can we just try with advice from outside? Is your ask temporary or permanent? How is the current workload? Can we afford to ship less quickly?

            - The succes and the quality of your work depends on your relationship with the people from Blendle. Take this month to invest in relations. Think outside the box: take a walk with someone, go to dinner, have a beer.
            - Get to know your Hiring Managers and Hiring team in particular.
        - **Implement Recruitment Analytics**
            - Take 2 weeks to come up with a solid plan and share it with us.

- **Get people in**
    
    We discuss how to get people in right here: 
    
    [Notion - The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases.](https://www.notion.so/blendle/Getting-people-in-sourcing-beae540c6eb54f87b43bb2123d50f23e)
    
    There are 2 types of candidates:
    
    - People who applied (via Homerun)
    - People who were sourced by us (approached via Linkedin or e-mail).
    
    There is a different approach in the first step. 
    
- **1. Application/interest and first review/screening**
    
    **Who is responsible:** hiring manager
    
    **Who is involved:** whole hiring team
    
    **Goal:** focus on filtering on hard variables (work) to filter out the best potential candidates.
    
    **Timing follow-up:** within a week
    
    **How:**
    
    - **People who applied ? review application ? ask input hiring team ? turn down or invite/phone screen**
    - **People who were sourced ? review information ? ask input hiring team ? invite/phone screen**: we only approach people who we think are really interesting so if we approach someone and he/she is interested, we always invite them for a cup of coffee.
- ***Optional: phone screening***
    
    **Who is responsible:** hiring manager
    
    **Who is involved:** hiring manager
    
    **Timing follow-up:** within a week

That's also what your hiring team is going to rate the candidates on, so it's good to know what they have to be rating.** 
    
    If it's a new role, it can be hard to pin these questions down. You can use this set of questions to ask experts in the field to help you pin down the profile as described in the section '[Getting people in'](https://www.notion.so/beae540c6eb54f87b43bb2123d50f23e) section 3: Sourcing:
    
    > Source to pin down your profile. New roles can be hard to pin down in a few bullet points. Since we can only hire (or turn down) someone if we know exactly what we are looking for, sourcing can be a good addition. Make a list of 20 people who match your profile so far on paper, ask your top 5 if they would like to have a cup of coffee with you. Use those conversations to finish your profile.

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again.

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people.

QUESTION: How do you determine someone's salary in the first place?
=========
Content: # Salary Review

- **How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?**
    
    We weigh up several variables:
    
    - **Benchmark:** internal and external.
        
        The most accurate way to determine the range where someone should be is comparing someone with a peer internally. During the hiring process you find out at what level someone is and you'll be able to compare him or her internally. Who would you compare this person to in terms of level? Is he/she better than X? If you notice that everyone is not as good as the people we have, but are paid more: think about raising the salary of our people. Keep in mind that - especially in tech - the market is on tilt. Big corporate pay a lot of money to even mediocare people in tech. We don't want to compete with them and that is a choice for new hires to make. 
        
    - **Classic figures:** experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise.
        
        This is a bit old school in a way, but also at Blendle there is a difference between someone who is a starter with no experience or someone with 8 years of experience. For some jobs/roles we need certain skills, expertise or even education. This always comes with a price tag. 
        
    - **Scarcity & market value.**

Content: - 6**. Offer and closing**
    
    **Who is responsible**: hiring manager/teamlead and HR
    
    **Who is involved**: hiring manager/teamlead and HR
    
    **Timing follow-up:** asap
    
    **Goal:** make a fair offer and close
    
    **Note:** hiring manager = teamlead and is by default in the lead in this process. If you feel like it's better if HR or someone else does the offer: do so.
    
    **How:**
    
    1. **Determine offer:** hiring manager and HR determine salary offer together. 
    
    We weigh in several variables:
    
    - **Benchmark:** internal and external.

Content: - **Scarcity & market value.**
        
        It's fair to say that it's harder to fill some positions compared to some other roles. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.
        
    - **Role and responsibilities.**
        
        Certain roles and people make more impact than others. This is reflected in pay.
        
    - **Actual impact and contribution**
        
        Since we don't really like job titles, it's good to look at someone's actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? Can we try to put that in numbers or concrete projects?
        
    - **Someone's starting point**
        
        If we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.
        
    
    *Note: all of this is not an exact science and is determined together, so please: ask for help.*
    
- **When do we talk about money?**
    - **Yearly company wide salary raises in January**
        
        Every year (in January) we take a good look at all the salaries at Cafeyn- Blendle. Right after the feedback cycle (which we use as input) we have salary talks with everyone. We chose to do this once a year so we don't have a constant conversation about money through the year.
        
- **Off cycle salary increases**
Source: Notion_DB\Blendle's Employee Handbook a834d55573614857a48a9ce9ec4194e3\Salary Review fd385c04dff04c2bb298f7085bf9e78d.md

Content: - **Off cycle salary increases**
    
    **Contract renewal** is not a moment that automatically means it is time to talk about money. We are not a company of people who demand *""give me X or I walk''*.  
    
    People can bring up salary any moment they want and we take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high) - see ""**How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?""**
    
    **Good reasons to raise offcycle**
    
    - Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.
    - Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone's impact and capabilities. It's important to be able to quantify that curve.
    - New information internally or externally.
    - New information by benchmarking studies or during hiring.
    
    **Not so good reasons to give a raise**
    
    - Colleague got another offer and uses this to get a raise.
    - 'I earn X for this company, that's a lot of money, I want a piece of the pie'.
    - Colleague just wants an incentive to stay. Money is never the answer, because it will fade - very - fast.
- **Control questions**
    
    Now before you finally decide
    
    - If we had to hire someone today for X's job, what would we pay them?
    - What would it cost Blendle as a business to find a new person (hard to replace, scarcity, time to hire, impact on day to day business & product)?

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","Several variables are considered when determining someone's salary in the first place. These variables include benchmarking (both internal and external), classic figures such as experience, education, and expertise, scarcity and market value, role and responsibilities, and actual impact and contribution. Additionally, someone's starting point and off-cycle factors such as drastic changes in role and responsibilities, steep learning curves, and new information internally or externally can also influence salary decisions. It is important to have control questions and consider the cost of finding a new person when making salary determinations. Salary discussions can occur at any time, and employees are encouraged to bring up concerns about their pay.

    Alright, so you came to the conclusion you need to hire someone. The next step is to pin down what you are (and aren't) exactly looking for in a candidate. This step is crucial. Rush this and you'll find yourself wobbling further down the road. 
    
    *Ask for help from recruitment/HR with this. They can help you out.*
    
    This set of questions should help you define your perfect candidate.
    
    - What team will the new person be joining? What is the goal of that team and how does that new person's job fit in there?
    - What problems are we aiming to solve by hiring this person? What would it look like when the problem is solved?
    - What impact do we expect this person to make in his/her - let's say - first 6 months?
    - What does good performance and success look like for this person? What do you expect from him/her?
    - What challenges or downsides does this role have?

Content: - What does good performance and success look like for this person? What do you expect from him/her?
    - What challenges or downsides does this role have?
    - What would you call the role? Is it an existing role (if yes: think if you can use someone as a blueprint, if no: make sure to check if our job title matches with other companies).
    - How much experience do you think this person needs? What kind and type of experience? In what kind and type of environments? Do you expect this person to be plug and play or is there room for learning and growing?
    - What could someone's career path look like at Blendle? What do we have to offer there?
    - Do you expect this person to lead a team or guild in a way?
    - What would a average week look like for this person?
    - What are examples of projects that were there the last quarter which could have been done by the new hire? What projects or topics are coming up?
    - What kind of skills, knowledge, expertise or experience does this person need? Make a distinction between must-haves and nice-to-haves. Be specific.
    - What kind of skills are lacking in the current team which this new person should bring?
    - Selling points: why would someone quit his job for this role? Think about the team, the role and Blendle.

    Sure, you are interviewing this person and it's your goal to be able to judge this person, but it's crucial you do this very subtly. Here are a few tips that might help.
    
    - **Let go of the structure.** Your a human, not a pre-programmed robot ;). Let the conversation happen and use the structure as a compass to make sure you cover everything. The most practical tip is to leave room for questions or to simply start explaining something from your side (just how you would do it when you're having a beer with someone). Try to feed information, even when you asked the questions up front and leave room for a question after that.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

**Snacks and more**

There will be beer, soda and snacks after All-hands presentations. 

On any other regular day:

- We might have chips etc, but op = op. We order snacks sometimes.
- This also goes for the cookies, fizzy drinks, beer or club mate.
- Fruit is something we want to provide everyday. If you notice we run out of fruit too fast and too often, ping our Office Manager so she can fix this.

If you are a big snack lover or don't want to be left empty-handed, consider bringing your own snacks.

You need to clean up your own shit. Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don't forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine. This 'system' works really well and keeps us away from bullshit like dishwasher duty.

Fahima is here every day, twice a day to clean this place, including toilets.

QUESTION: Why is saying goodbye to colleagues considered a normal and natural thing at Blendle?
=========
Content: # Firing

Saying goodbye to Blendle (from a colleague) and to a colleague (from Blendle) is a very normal and natural thing. When done right, it can even be a beautiful thing. 

We advise you to read the backdrop below first, but feel free to jump in right away with the 'Here's what you can do'-section :). General note: you do not have to do this alone, so please ask for advice and help!

- **Backdrop**
    
    Saying goodbye to Blendle (from a colleague) and to a colleague (from Blendle) is a very normal and natural thing. When done right, it can even be a beautiful thing.
    
    Saying goodbye to people is also an important part of keeping your team on the right track. Firing can even be a part of your [Personnel Planning](Hiring%20fd6a5e1f88dd4476988147a3a62e1f0d.md). The most common situation will be when you think someone is no longer a good match with Blendle for whatever reason. This doesn't happen overnight, so try to spot situations where this is happening. 
    
    To make things clear: HR and Rick and Alex will help you with this, but we want this to be on your agenda. HR will take care of the process and paper- and legal work. Rick and Alex will help with the tough conversations. **The most important work happens months before that and that's where you come in.**
    
    Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :).
Source: Notion_DB\Blendle's Employee Handbook a834d55573614857a48a9ce9ec4194e3\Firing b870eff4bf1d42ae9f7e119b6660f4fc.md

Content: - Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

When working at Blendle, there are a few things you should know. Not to scare you. It is just something to be aware of.

## **1. Blendle is a startup**

Blendle is a startup. Your salary (and all benefits) is paid from money from investors. You (and the people you work with) are part of the solution to the problem we are trying to solve. Time lost or wasted is bad, because it doesn?t bring us closer to the goal: supporting quality journalism. We need money to do so. Finding the right product-market fit (building a freaking beautiful product which the whole world wants to use) and becoming profitable is crucial to reaching the end goal.

We tend to say to people (imagine a smile on our face): ?Hey, but no pressure!?, and then we both start to laugh (or else it is awkward). Well let me say this once, loud and clear: we realise that there is pressure. It can be pretty intense. This is not a regular corporate day job, and that has its up- and downsides. Example upside: we don?t care where and when you work, which means flexibility. Example downside: you have to be able to regulate yourself, which can be hard.

There are a lot of product/business choices made because of this survival mode. Some you might like (a lot of freedom and responsibility in your work), some you might dislike (pressure on shipping, for example). **Bottom line: survival mode results in a fast-paced, high-pressure, sometimes hectic/chaotic environment.**

Content: You?ve made it to the end of this post. Respect. Last but not least is introducing yourself. How? Just send an email to [all@blendle.com](mailto:all@blendle.com) before your first day.

First impressions count (no pressure) and [here are all the intro emails](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IFEw_LBFeEErL73W9yxBT-QYCK9Ug2yx33eiPSwlu2A/edit#heading=h.dddc6c1lldbp) (not public) of the colleagues who joined before you (no pressure), make sure to add your own too (again, no pressure).

As you can see, it grew into one big funny gif-fest, which wasn?t our intention ;).

The idea behind it is that your new colleagues get a glimpse of who you are, what you like/dislike, why you are joining Blendle and what you?re going to do. Yes we are suckers for gifs, but we?d like a picture of you even more. Nothing fancy, just you, so everybody recognizes you when you?re grabbing a cup of tea in the canteen. Oh, and short = sweet. Nothing like this enormous onboarding post...

FINAL ANSWER:","Saying goodbye to colleagues is considered a normal and natural thing at Blendle because it is seen as an important part of keeping the team on the right track and maintaining a healthy work environment. It is also recognized that people may have different beliefs or that their time at the company may come to an end, and it is encouraged to try to fix any issues together before deciding to part ways. The process of saying goodbye is supported by HR, Rick, and Alex, but it is also emphasized that it is a collective responsibility and that colleagues should seek advice and help when needed.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: How do I report a problem with company software or tools?
=========
Content: People team uses this system to save and track all your personal documents and information as well. Whenever something changes, this will go through this system. You can change your contact information and address if you move. You can also always access this system to have a look at your documents, eg contract, reviews etc.

You can also send in your requests for reimbursement of business expenses and holidays.   

**Security**

We care about security. So, whenever possible (Google apps, GitHub etc): use two-factor authentication! And please turn on Full Disk Encryption (FileVault on Mac) on your computer. And of course, whether you're at the office or somewhere else,?e sure to lock your computer whenever you are AFK. And whenever you hear ?Brace, Brace!?, be sure to get yourself into brace-position. It is for your own and our safety. :-)

For sharing secure stuff with each other we use [Tresorit](https://tresorit.com/). Be sure to download that! If you need it, your team will also mention this, so don?t worry! Oh, and in case you?re wondering: we don?t share any user information via Slack or Google.

Content: # Addressing harassment

You are *always* in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward when you report an incident. We encourage you to talk about what happened.

If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8). In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it?s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. 

Here are the steps you can take, either:

- **Talk to the offender**. If you suspect that an offender doesn?t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.

Content: Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :). 
    

## Here's what you can do:

1. Actively **think** about the possibility that someone's time at Blendle is up. At least every month for everyone in your team.
2. **Flag** this at HR/MT when that happens. 
3. **Ask** for help if needed already at this stage.
4. **Analyse** (maybe together) the problem and give feedback to the person in question: try to get on the same page about where things go 'wrong'. These are pointers which might steer your thoughts. Real situations are always more complex. 
    - Someone is **underperforming**. Try using [the Matrix?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=0) to track down the areas where you think things should improve. Give actionable feedback and try to come up with concrete points to work on in his/her personal goals. Don't wait for the feedback cycle, the time is always now.
    - Someone **stopped growing or learning**. This isn't necessarily an immediate problem, but it can be because most people like working at Blendle because they grow and learn so much. Someone standing still for a year is a red flag.

Content: **Slack**

We use Slack for internal communication. This gives us all the ability to stalk each other,?se GIFs, work on Slack-bots, etc. etc. It comes as a web app, iOS app, Android App, OSX app and Windows app. Just download the apps for your platforms of choice. With [**this link](https://blendle.slack.com/signup)** you can create your own Slack account with your @blendle account (SSO for the win!). You can join all the relevant channels of your choice. Slack can also be a big distraction, so make sure to [**check out the do-not-disturb-functionalities](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/214908388-Do-Not-Disturb-and-snooze-settings).** If you run into any trouble, just let me know.

**Jira**

I?ve also sent you an invite (on your Blendle mail) for Jira. We use it for all sorts of things. Of course the occasional sprint planning but support uses it to flag issues and get them on sprints for example. Have a look around. When joining your team you?ll know soon enough which board to join.

Content: - We believe aiming for diversity numbers narrows the conversation on the topic for now. We decided to use the data to feed the conversation but not implement quotas.

**What we do:**

- Fight bias in hiring. For example by not asking for a resume when people apply, but asking questions related to the actual job. This way the first judgement is based on relevant information, not on age or a picture.
- Emphasize the fact that we would like more diverse profiles to reply on our job postings by adding it to our vacancies. In Dutch: *""Niet onbelangrijk: we vinden diversiteit belangrijk, dus laat je alsjeblieft niet tegenhouden om te solliciteren als je anders denkt of er anders uitziet. Dat vinden we juist mooi.""* And in English: *""Final remark: we think it's important to have a diverse workforce, so please don't hesitate to apply if you think or look differently. We actually like that.""*
- Track the basic data.
- Guard equal pay.
- Actively source diverse profiles.
- Internal campaign for speaking English, sources for more diverse pipelines with hiring, make this a recurring topic on the HR agenda.

Content: # Diversity and Inclusion

It was this ^^ picture from our Christmas party three years ago which got us some replies on Twitter. A lot of males and a lot of white. We know that we need to do better to make Blendle a more diverse workplace. We spend a lot of time thinking about diversity and inclusion. After reading, talking and listening, we learned a few things:

- This is a sensitive topic: feelings and opinions are involved.
- This is a trending topic: there is a lot of noise and it's hard to pin down the essence.
- This is not a new, but renewed topic.
- Diversity and inclusion is more of a scale than a simple yes or no statement.
- Everyone is biased and every company is at risk of becoming less diverse and inclusive.
- A more diverse and inclusive company **>** a less diverse and inclusive company for a lot of reasons.
- Diversity and inclusion is not 'just' about gender or race, so looking at just those numbers can limit your thoughts on this topic. The practical side of this topic is also way more subtle.

**Diversity and inclusion at Blendle**

What we know now:

- We believe in the importance of a **diverse** team because we believe **it's crucial to our succes and product.** We try to add meaning to peoples everyday life by helping them reach quality content instead of cat gifs on Facebook. This can only be done by a group of people with different backgrounds, expertise, personalities, talents, ideas and opinions.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known.

QUESTION: Why is feedback important?
=========
Content: # Leading Feedback

We can not stress enough how we value feedback in all its forms.?*Good feedback is at the center of all people-related topics**. Good feedback is the key to a good collaboration, happy people and even a successful company. As a lead, you are responsible for leading the feedback for your people. This section will help you do so. Look at this list as a toolkit for you and your colleagues. 

[Our Feedback Process](Our%20Feedback%20Process%20c40fc80d546045ffb7076797301e81a8.md)

- **Make notes**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Well, because you forget. Plus making notes forces you to constantly think about the feedback. We would recommend making it a habit at the end of the week (weekly review ftw!): how did X do? 
    
    If you have a good system, it will also allow you to look back. ?Didn?t we discuss this already a year ago? It?s still an issue?. It also shows that you don?t forget and take this seriously.
    
    **How?**
    
    Docs, Evernote, Todoist, Wunderlist, Word, Things or even a notebook (I would not recommend a notebook). Whatever works. Just make small notes: You did well on project X and meeting Y, because ABC. I really liked when you did X, because it had an effect on ABC. It helps you during the reviews every 6 months.
    
- **Continuous Feedback**
    
    **Why?**

Content: - **Continuous Feedback**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Don?t save up feedback, it?s less powerful. Just speak your mind. The more often you do this, the easier it gets. This goes both ways: good and bad. I never heard someone say he or she got too much feedback.
    
    **How?** 
    
    Face to face is best (e-mail/slack/chat is ok for practical stuff).
    
    Praise in public, feedback 1on1.
    
    Think about:
    
    - quality of work: you did well on X. Because ABC.
    - way of working: you were slow and distracted, how can I help?
    - behaviour: try not to interrupt people during the meeting.
    
    There are a lot of tips out there on how to give feedback.
    
    I like the HIP-approach:
    
    - **H**umble
    - **H**elpful
    - **I**mmediate
    - **I**n person
    - **P**rivate criticism/ **P**ublic Praise
    - Not about **P**ersonality
    
    Source:
    
    [A HIP Approach to Feedback | Achieve Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/a-hip-approach-to-feedback/)
    
- **Have scheduled (bi-)weekly 1on1's**
    
    **Why?**
    
    It?s important and it's not going to happen if you don?t schedule it. If all is fine it might feel too much. It isn?t. Goal is to ?stay in touch? and simply have a relationship with someone. The relationship is the basis for being able to give good feedback and it makes it easier to receive too.
    
    **How?**

- Don?t save all your feedback up - give at the time of the event (or shortly after) -  There should be no surprises
- Don't make it personal.  Focus on the situation not the person. and how you can work together to improve it for next time.
- Examples are fine, but don't use them for the blame game.
- Reflect on your intention in giving someone your feedback. Are you giving it to help someone or to shame someone?  Did you have a role in the situation that happened?
- Be clear and direct, subtle gibberish doesn't help anyone.
- Remember A-P-P-R-E-C-I-A-T-I-O-N helps motivate and shows people their unique value.

<aside>
? Tips for r**eceiving feedback**

</aside>

- Always assume feedback is given to help you
- Be open to listening and don't get stuck in a spiral of defending or pointing fingers back.
Take responsibility if something went wrong and focus on learning how to work together better.
- Be curious - Why is this feedback given to you? What is really at the root of it?  Is it the feedback itself that indicates a problem or is some emotion underlying it that needs to be addressed?

Content: # Our Feedback Process

> At Blendle we value the **Freedom** and **Responsibility** of giving **Proactive** and **Honest** feedback to drive excellent **Team Work**.   We try to build input points into everything we do.  We even got feedback on upgrading our Feedback process - all of which is incorporated into the new process below.
> 

# **Typical Feedback Moments @ Blendle:**

- **Sprint retro** - every 2 weeks.  How did the cycle go?  What did we learn? How did we feel?
- **Agile Process retro** - Monthly.  How can we improve the process and collaboration?
- **BIG HR People Surve**y - two times a year Q1 and Q4 on Employee experience.
- **EVERYDAY!**

# The **Quarterly Coaching Feedback Process**

At least every Quarter we want to make sure you get a formal feedback and coaching conversation focused on your personal and professional development, and progress.  And luckily, the quarterly process aligns to the timing of our Objectives Goals Strategies Measures, so you can chat about both with your manager at the same time.

### The Process:

**YOU** run ***your*** process - End to End.  By having full ownership you control your development (that ****responsible** value again ?) and focus on **teamwork** **and ****honesty ****by discussing feedback together (rather than through your manager).  So you're developing from the development process itself!

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","Feedback is important because it is at the center of all people-related topics and is key to a good collaboration, happy people, and a successful company. It helps in building relationships, improving performance, and driving personal and professional development. Giving feedback in a timely manner, being clear and direct, and focusing on the situation rather than the person are some tips for giving useful feedback. Being open to listening, taking responsibility, and being curious are important when receiving feedback. Feedback can be given continuously and should not be saved up, and having scheduled 1-on-1 meetings can facilitate regular feedback exchanges. The feedback process at Blendle emphasizes proactive and honest feedback, and there are various feedback moments and processes in place to ensure continuous improvement and development.

QUESTION: Who should be involved when someone's time at Blendle is up?
=========
Content: - Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

## Here's what you can do:

1. Actively **think** about the possibility that someone's time at Blendle is up. At least every month for everyone in your team.
2. **Flag** this at HR/MT when that happens. 
3. **Ask** for help if needed already at this stage.
4. **Analyse** (maybe together) the problem and give feedback to the person in question: try to get on the same page about where things go 'wrong'. These are pointers which might steer your thoughts. Real situations are always more complex. 
    - Someone is **underperforming**. Try using [the Matrix?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=0) to track down the areas where you think things should improve. Give actionable feedback and try to come up with concrete points to work on in his/her personal goals. Don't wait for the feedback cycle, the time is always now.
    - Someone **stopped growing or learning**. This isn't necessarily an immediate problem, but it can be because most people like working at Blendle because they grow and learn so much. Someone standing still for a year is a red flag.

Content: # People System - Salarisbalie - Requesting Time off & Expensing

Salarisbalie is our payroll specialist and makes sure we get paid correctly every month, Salarisbalie works within a tool called NMBRS. NMBRS is used for saving and monitoring all personnel files,  personal information, holidays, dossiers, contracts, etc. 

When you start at Blendle, you get onboarded in this system. Easy peasy, everything in one place. 

You, HR and your lead have access to this self service tool.

So what can you do with Nmbrs?   Next to accessing your personal information and contracts, you can also change your contact information yourself. Plus, requesting time off and claiming expenses just became a whole lot easier: 

- **Time off request**
    
    **Why are we doing this if we have unlimited holidays?**
    The ""unlimited fair use"" rule stays. We are adding the balance for legal reasons. 
    
    And while we don't have a maximum, we do have a **minimum** that we want you to take, to keep you healthy - 20 days each year, for a 40 hour contract. 
    
    Plus, NMBRS has a super easy way to overview who is out of office and when, Blendle wide.  A great tool for teams and managers to plan work and availability especially around big projects or releases.
    
    **It looks weird in the system.....I see a negative balance!**

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people.

QUESTION: When does the Agile Process retro take place?
=========
Content: # Our Feedback Process

> At Blendle we value the **Freedom** and **Responsibility** of giving **Proactive** and **Honest** feedback to drive excellent **Team Work**.   We try to build input points into everything we do.  We even got feedback on upgrading our Feedback process - all of which is incorporated into the new process below.
> 

# **Typical Feedback Moments @ Blendle:**

- **Sprint retro** - every 2 weeks.  How did the cycle go?  What did we learn? How did we feel?
- **Agile Process retro** - Monthly.  How can we improve the process and collaboration?
- **BIG HR People Surve**y - two times a year Q1 and Q4 on Employee experience.
- **EVERYDAY!**

# The **Quarterly Coaching Feedback Process**

At least every Quarter we want to make sure you get a formal feedback and coaching conversation focused on your personal and professional development, and progress.  And luckily, the quarterly process aligns to the timing of our Objectives Goals Strategies Measures, so you can chat about both with your manager at the same time.

### The Process:

**YOU** run ***your*** process - End to End.  By having full ownership you control your development (that ****responsible** value again ?) and focus on **teamwork** **and ****honesty ****by discussing feedback together (rather than through your manager).  So you're developing from the development process itself!

Content: - Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.

Content: ?In other words, I would tell the manager what everybody said but not who said it. Not because I wanted to foster secrecy, but because I wanted to help get the information out there,? says Scott. ?If there were too many things the team didn?t feel comfortable saying directly to their boss, and if it wasn?t getting better over time, that became the top thing I worked with the manager to change.?

    **Upward feedback**
    
    Something you can do yourself is asking for upward feedback using a typeform/googleform. Send these questions to your team and see where you're at:
    
    - My teamlead regularly gives me actionable feedback that helps me improve my performance.
    - My teamlead does not micromanage (i.e., get involved in details that should be handled at other levels).
    - My teamlead regularly shares relevant info and/or insights from the MT.
    - My teamlead is easy to approach with problems/concerns/feedback.
    - My teamlead communicates clear goals for our team.
    - My teamlead keeps the team focus on our priority results/deliverables/OKR?s.

Content: # Our Feedback Process

> At Blendle we value the **Freedom** and **Responsibility** of giving **Proactive** and **Honest** feedback to drive excellent **Team Work**.   We try to build input points into everything we do.  We even got feedback on upgrading our Feedback process - all of which is incorporated into the new process below.
> 

# **Typical Feedback Moments @ Blendle:**

- **Sprint retro** - every 2 weeks.  How did the cycle go?  What did we learn? How did we feel?
- **Agile Process retro** - Monthly.  How can we improve the process and collaboration?
- **BIG HR People Surve**y - two times a year Q1 and Q4 on Employee experience.
- **EVERYDAY!**

# The **Quarterly Coaching Feedback Process**

At least every Quarter we want to make sure you get a formal feedback and coaching conversation focused on your personal and professional development, and progress.  And luckily, the quarterly process aligns to the timing of our Objectives Goals Strategies Measures, so you can chat about both with your manager at the same time.

### The Process:

**YOU** run ***your*** process - End to End.  By having full ownership you control your development (that ****responsible** value again ?) and focus on **teamwork** **and ****honesty ****by discussing feedback together (rather than through your manager).  So you're developing from the development process itself!

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22.

QUESTION: Why is it considered healthy for people to move on from Blendle after a while?
=========
Content: - Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

Content: **Headspace**

To keep your head in shape, we pay for the best apps to help you do so: Headspace to stay calm and mindful and **Things** to boost your productivity and help you reach your goals. Blendle offers reimbursement on your Headspace subscription. Leave your name [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-zlsECyft1A7SV30dsbaxGeS7F66u2Yte7sOli8bc4k/edit?ts=5ae08e58#gid=0) and you will receive a monthly reimbursement together with your salary.

**Lunch**

At Blendle we tend to lunch together. Buurtboer arranges nice lunches including sandwiches (to be self-made), salad, eggs and veggies. Just get your plate, walk to the salad bar (yes we got a salad bar from Marktplaats for 100 euros), grab whatever you like and enjoy the company of your colleagues (or don?t, whatever). Any allergies or preferences? Let us know at [officemanagement@blendle.com](mailto:officemanagement@blendle.com).

Don?t be afraid to help out on cleaning up after lunch. You?ll experience this thing called gratitude if you do?

**[Sick](Calling%20in%20sick%20better%20ca3c036d25a24fcf988c410c9fc67108.md)?**

Tough luck! Get over it! No, we care for each other so we will feel sorry for you. And everyone is willing to help out if you get in a tough spot being ill at home. To get the needed help or rest, just let your team lead know you?re staying at home (or going home).

Content: How does that look? Sometimes it?s better to skip a morning stand-up to visit a physio for your constant headache. You are acting in Blendle?s interest when doing this.
    
- **Check your work, job and role**
    
    
    Are you doing the right job? Do you get energy from what you are doing? Do you feel like you?re making a difference? Do you love most of it? Of course there will be stuff you don?t like, that?s totally normal. But are you doing things you are good at and you like? And is there enough challenge, perspective and room to grow?
    
    Are you getting enough praise and feedback? Do you know what is expected from you? Do you know how you are doing at the moment?
    
    It?s really important that you know how your team and team leads think you are doing. Ask them! What are you doing well, what needs to improve. Use the structure we came up with: 1on1?s, personal goals, feedback sessions, peer reviews. But feel free to alter them in order for them to work for you. Just don?t do nothing.
    
- **Last but not least: get informed.**
    
    There is a lot of information out there. Inform yourself. It will help you recognize a potential threat earlier and help you act on that.

FINAL ANSWER:","It is considered healthy for people to move on from Blendle after a while because they may believe in a different direction for the company or the team, or because it's simply time for them to move on and explore new opportunities. It is important to have open communication and try to fix any issues together before deciding to part ways.

    There are 2 types of candidates:
    
    - People who applied (via Homerun)
    - People who were sourced by us (approached via Linkedin or e-mail).
    
    There is a different approach in the first step. 
    
- **1. Application/interest and first review/screening**
    
    **Who is responsible:** hiring manager
    
    **Who is involved:** whole hiring team
    
    **Goal:** focus on filtering on hard variables (work) to filter out the best potential candidates.
    
    **Timing follow-up:** within a week
    
    **How:**
    
    - **People who applied ? review application ? ask input hiring team ? turn down or invite/phone screen**
    - **People who were sourced ? review information ? ask input hiring team ? invite/phone screen**: we only approach people who we think are really interesting so if we approach someone and he/she is interested, we always invite them for a cup of coffee.
- ***Optional: phone screening***

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life.

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.

QUESTION: How long does the migration and relocation procedure usually take?
=========
Content: ### Where to start

We can basically hire anyone from anywhere in the world. But the migration and relocation procedure will be different for some countries. It's good to know that the migration procedure and relocation can take up to 8 weeks. So when interviewing a new candidate, that should be something to be aware of.  The information below should give you a good idea of what the differences are between different countries. 

As a lead, if you want to move forward with a candidate and make an offer, please contact HR for support first. In general the procedure looks like something like this:

1. There is a green light after the pair session;
2. Contact HR to discuss the salary, startdate and the relocation offer. In some cases HR needs to contact EMG in advance to check some legal stuff;
3. You have a ""yes"" from our candidate? HR can take over from here and will start the procedure with EMG;
4. HR will keep you up to date and help you with the on-boarding;
5. HR needs to be up to date about renewals or any other significant changes in salary or contract. These things have consequences for the work permit of our new colleague.

## Some important reminders

- It can take up to 8 weeks before a new hire can actually start working at Blendle.
- It's important to inform the candidates about the (lack of) housing in Utrecht, be realistic.
- We offer a relocation packages which can be customised within some boundries.

FINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.

QUESTION: When do you talk about money and have salary discussions?
=========
Content: - **Off cycle salary increases**
    
    **Contract renewal** is not a moment that automatically means it is time to talk about money. We are not a company of people who demand *""give me X or I walk''*.  
    
    People can bring up salary any moment they want and we take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high) - see ""**How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?""**
    
    **Good reasons to raise offcycle**
    
    - Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.
    - Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone's impact and capabilities. It's important to be able to quantify that curve.
    - New information internally or externally.
    - New information by benchmarking studies or during hiring.
    
    **Not so good reasons to give a raise**
    
    - Colleague got another offer and uses this to get a raise.
    - 'I earn X for this company, that's a lot of money, I want a piece of the pie'.
    - Colleague just wants an incentive to stay. Money is never the answer, because it will fade - very - fast.
- **Control questions**
    
    Now before you finally decide
    
    - If we had to hire someone today for X's job, what would we pay them?
    - What would it cost Blendle as a business to find a new person (hard to replace, scarcity, time to hire, impact on day to day business & product)?
Source: Notion_DB\Blendle's Employee Handbook a834d55573614857a48a9ce9ec4194e3\Salary Review fd385c04dff04c2bb298f7085bf9e78d.md

Content: - **Scarcity & market value.**
        
        It's fair to say that it's harder to fill some positions compared to some other roles. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.
        
    - **Role and responsibilities.**
        
        Certain roles and people make more impact than others. This is reflected in pay.
        
    - **Actual impact and contribution**
        
        Since we don't really like job titles, it's good to look at someone's actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? Can we try to put that in numbers or concrete projects?
        
    - **Someone's starting point**
        
        If we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.
        
    
    *Note: all of this is not an exact science and is determined together, so please: ask for help.*
    
- **When do we talk about money?**
    - **Yearly company wide salary raises in January**
        
        Every year (in January) we take a good look at all the salaries at Cafeyn- Blendle. Right after the feedback cycle (which we use as input) we have salary talks with everyone. We chose to do this once a year so we don't have a constant conversation about money through the year.

Content: # Salary Review

- **How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?**
    
    We weigh up several variables:
    
    - **Benchmark:** internal and external.
        
        The most accurate way to determine the range where someone should be is comparing someone with a peer internally. During the hiring process you find out at what level someone is and you'll be able to compare him or her internally. Who would you compare this person to in terms of level? Is he/she better than X? If you notice that everyone is not as good as the people we have, but are paid more: think about raising the salary of our people. Keep in mind that - especially in tech - the market is on tilt. Big corporate pay a lot of money to even mediocare people in tech. We don't want to compete with them and that is a choice for new hires to make. 
        
    - **Classic figures:** experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise.
        
        This is a bit old school in a way, but also at Blendle there is a difference between someone who is a starter with no experience or someone with 8 years of experience. For some jobs/roles we need certain skills, expertise or even education. This always comes with a price tag. 
        
    - **Scarcity & market value.**

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","Salary discussions and talks about money can happen at any time. Employees are encouraged to bring up salary if they feel it is too low or too high. Off-cycle salary increases can be considered for reasons such as drastic changes in role and responsibilities, steep learning curves, new information internally or externally, or benchmarking studies. However, reasons such as a colleague getting another offer or wanting an incentive to stay are not considered good reasons for a raise. Yearly company-wide salary raises take place in January, and off-cycle salary increases can be discussed as needed. The determination of someone's salary takes into account benchmarks, experience, education, specific knowledge, expertise, scarcity, and market value. Fit questions and other interview questions are also used to assess candidates during the hiring process.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

QUESTION: Why is scheduling regular 1-on-1 meetings important?
=========
Content: **How?** 
    
    It works best if you have a standard agenda for this meeting. I would not recommend winging it every time. 
    
    [re:Work - Guide: Coach managers to coach](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-coach-managers-to-coach/steps/hold-effective-1-1-meetings/)
    
    Here?s an outline we like.
    
    - Personal: How are you feeling today? Why is that? What?s going on in your life at the moment? What?s on your mind?
    - Work: What are you working on? What do you like/dislike? Any roadblocks/issues?
    - Feedback and coaching: Share the feedback you wrote down. Do you have any feedback for me?
    - Goals: How are you progressing on your personal goals? Need help?
    
    *Review action points last week and make new ones*
    
    I would recommend asking your team member to come up with an agenda, to also make them feel they are in control and in the lead.
    
    Last but not least: take 15-30 minutes to prepare. Both parties shouldn?t accept the meeting going forward without preparing.
    
    We can highly recommend listening to this three part course from Manager Tools on 1:1?s. It's sometimes a bit cheesy (including the theme music) but the contents are very much worth it.

Content: - **Continuous Feedback**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Don?t save up feedback, it?s less powerful. Just speak your mind. The more often you do this, the easier it gets. This goes both ways: good and bad. I never heard someone say he or she got too much feedback.
    
    **How?** 
    
    Face to face is best (e-mail/slack/chat is ok for practical stuff).
    
    Praise in public, feedback 1on1.
    
    Think about:
    
    - quality of work: you did well on X. Because ABC.
    - way of working: you were slow and distracted, how can I help?
    - behaviour: try not to interrupt people during the meeting.
    
    There are a lot of tips out there on how to give feedback.
    
    I like the HIP-approach:
    
    - **H**umble
    - **H**elpful
    - **I**mmediate
    - **I**n person
    - **P**rivate criticism/ **P**ublic Praise
    - Not about **P**ersonality
    
    Source:
    
    [A HIP Approach to Feedback | Achieve Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/a-hip-approach-to-feedback/)
    
- **Have scheduled (bi-)weekly 1on1's**
    
    **Why?**
    
    It?s important and it's not going to happen if you don?t schedule it. If all is fine it might feel too much. It isn?t. Goal is to ?stay in touch? and simply have a relationship with someone. The relationship is the basis for being able to give good feedback and it makes it easier to receive too.

- Optional: **Skip level session and upward feedback**
    
    **Skip level session:** 
    
    Also called an upward feedback session. A session where your team members sit down with your lead to talk about you. Your lead makes notes and shares them with you afterwords. 
    
    ?If you?re a manager of managers, you need to make sure that everyone on your team feels they can criticize their boss,? Scott says. But she?s quick to note that this does not mean encouraging your team to be boss killers. Instead, she recommends putting this advice into practice with a simple meeting ? commonly called a 'skip-level meeting,' though that sounds hierarchical, so she prefers to call them 'manager guidance sessions.'
    
    The process is straightforward: First, let your managers know that you?ll be scheduling a meeting with their direct reports. Get them comfortable with the idea, and make it clear that this meeting is intended to be helpful to them. Then explain the process to the reports, again making it clear that the goal of the meeting is to help their boss be a better manager ? and that the meeting is not for attribution.

Content: **You have the responsibility to find out what rhythm works for you best, to be at your best.** Simply because we believe not everybody works the same way. So do you have the rhythm which works best for you? We want everybody to be able to bring their child, cat or car to daycare. Not because we love cats in particular (yes we do), but we want nothing to get in your way of getting the most out of your day. The fact that we don?t care when and how many times you go to a doctor, psych or barber is not because we want to be the ?cool employer?, but because you need your health to add value that day. So if that means visiting the barber once a week on Monday morning: please do.
    
    So have you found your rhythm yet? Rolo hates traffic jams so you?ll see him coming and going at exotic times. Alex is scrolling through his Twitter feed till late at night so you won't see him before 11:00 at the office. Rick?s alarm clock is set at 6:00 and we know he doesn?t snooze, so he?s in at 8:00, leaving early to have dinner with his wife.
    
    It might help announcing changes in your rythm to your team. It makes it feel legit for you, and your team members can help you with it.
    
    When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","Scheduling regular 1-on-1 meetings is important because it allows for effective communication, feedback, and goal-setting between managers and team members. These meetings provide an opportunity to discuss personal and work-related matters, share feedback, and track progress on goals. It is recommended to have a standard agenda for these meetings and for both parties to come prepared. Regular 1-on-1 meetings help build relationships and create a foundation for giving and receiving feedback. Additionally, optional skip level sessions or upward feedback sessions can be conducted to gather feedback about managers from their team members. Finding the right rhythm and schedule for these meetings is important to ensure productivity and well-being.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: How can team leads and employees work together to improve the situation?
=========
Content: Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :). 
    

## Here's what you can do:

1. Actively **think** about the possibility that someone's time at Blendle is up. At least every month for everyone in your team.
2. **Flag** this at HR/MT when that happens. 
3. **Ask** for help if needed already at this stage.
4. **Analyse** (maybe together) the problem and give feedback to the person in question: try to get on the same page about where things go 'wrong'. These are pointers which might steer your thoughts. Real situations are always more complex. 
    - Someone is **underperforming**. Try using [the Matrix?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=0) to track down the areas where you think things should improve. Give actionable feedback and try to come up with concrete points to work on in his/her personal goals. Don't wait for the feedback cycle, the time is always now.
    - Someone **stopped growing or learning**. This isn't necessarily an immediate problem, but it can be because most people like working at Blendle because they grow and learn so much. Someone standing still for a year is a red flag.
Source: Notion_DB\Blendle's Employee Handbook a834d55573614857a48a9ce9ec4194e3\Firing b870eff4bf1d42ae9f7e119b6660f4fc.md

Content: - Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

    Something you can do yourself is asking for upward feedback using a typeform/googleform. Send these questions to your team and see where you're at:
    
    - My teamlead regularly gives me actionable feedback that helps me improve my performance.
    - My teamlead does not micromanage (i.e., get involved in details that should be handled at other levels).
    - My teamlead regularly shares relevant info and/or insights from the MT.
    - My teamlead is easy to approach with problems/concerns/feedback.
    - My teamlead communicates clear goals for our team.
    - My teamlead keeps the team focus on our priority results/deliverables/OKR?s.

Bring it up with someone you trust (HR, your team lead, Alexander, just anyone) and let?s try to fix it or at least talk about it.

Blendle cares. We care. So if you?re struggling, let?s change things to make sure you are happy, healthy and at your best.

- **Look at your work life balance**
    
    
    > In engineering, people talk about asset integrity, which means that you service the machinery before it breaks. In modern organizations, the work is thinking and the machinery is your brain. We know from cognitive science that there are hard limits to what the brain can deal with. And yet, there?s an awful lot in the way we work which flies in the face of that. We think that if we work through the night, we?re being very clever. We?re not. We think we can work long hours ? month after month, year after year ? and that there won?t be any wear and tear. But there is.

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

Content: ? **Tips for giving useful feedback**

</aside>

![Our%20Feedback%20Process%20c40fc80d546045ffb7076797301e81a8/Untitled.png](Our%20Feedback%20Process%20c40fc80d546045ffb7076797301e81a8/Untitled.png)

- Don?t save all your feedback up - give at the time of the event (or shortly after) -  There should be no surprises
- Don't make it personal.  Focus on the situation not the person. and how you can work together to improve it for next time.
- Examples are fine, but don't use them for the blame game.
- Reflect on your intention in giving someone your feedback. Are you giving it to help someone or to shame someone?  Did you have a role in the situation that happened?
- Be clear and direct, subtle gibberish doesn't help anyone.
- Remember A-P-P-R-E-C-I-A-T-I-O-N helps motivate and shows people their unique value.

<aside>
? Tips for r**eceiving feedback**

</aside>

- Always assume feedback is given to help you
- Be open to listening and don't get stuck in a spiral of defending or pointing fingers back.
Take responsibility if something went wrong and focus on learning how to work together better.
- Be curious - Why is this feedback given to you? What is really at the root of it?  Is it the feedback itself that indicates a problem or is some emotion underlying it that needs to be addressed?

Content: Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :). 
    

## Here's what you can do:

1. Actively **think** about the possibility that someone's time at Blendle is up. At least every month for everyone in your team.
2. **Flag** this at HR/MT when that happens. 
3. **Ask** for help if needed already at this stage.
4. **Analyse** (maybe together) the problem and give feedback to the person in question: try to get on the same page about where things go 'wrong'. These are pointers which might steer your thoughts. Real situations are always more complex. 
    - Someone is **underperforming**. Try using [the Matrix?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=0) to track down the areas where you think things should improve. Give actionable feedback and try to come up with concrete points to work on in his/her personal goals. Don't wait for the feedback cycle, the time is always now.
    - Someone **stopped growing or learning**. This isn't necessarily an immediate problem, but it can be because most people like working at Blendle because they grow and learn so much. Someone standing still for a year is a red flag.

Content: - **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?
    
    Are you giving praise?
    
    Are you actively challenging your team?
    
    Are you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?
    
    Are you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?
    
    Is your schedule (and that of your team) in a healthy rhythm (work-life balance)? You set the example.
    
    Is your team taking regular holidays/long weekends?
    
    Here?s an article about how to help your team with this:

Content: # Our Feedback Process

> At Blendle we value the **Freedom** and **Responsibility** of giving **Proactive** and **Honest** feedback to drive excellent **Team Work**.   We try to build input points into everything we do.  We even got feedback on upgrading our Feedback process - all of which is incorporated into the new process below.
> 

# **Typical Feedback Moments @ Blendle:**

- **Sprint retro** - every 2 weeks.  How did the cycle go?  What did we learn? How did we feel?
- **Agile Process retro** - Monthly.  How can we improve the process and collaboration?
- **BIG HR People Surve**y - two times a year Q1 and Q4 on Employee experience.
- **EVERYDAY!**

# The **Quarterly Coaching Feedback Process**

At least every Quarter we want to make sure you get a formal feedback and coaching conversation focused on your personal and professional development, and progress.  And luckily, the quarterly process aligns to the timing of our Objectives Goals Strategies Measures, so you can chat about both with your manager at the same time.

### The Process:

**YOU** run ***your*** process - End to End.  By having full ownership you control your development (that ****responsible** value again ?) and focus on **teamwork** **and ****honesty ****by discussing feedback together (rather than through your manager).  So you're developing from the development process itself!

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

QUESTION: Why is it important to proactively share information from high-level meetings?
=========
Content: ?In other words, I would tell the manager what everybody said but not who said it. Not because I wanted to foster secrecy, but because I wanted to help get the information out there,? says Scott. ?If there were too many things the team didn?t feel comfortable saying directly to their boss, and if it wasn?t getting better over time, that became the top thing I worked with the manager to change.?

    Just let us know if you would like one and we will organize it for you :).
    
    **Upward feedback**
    
    Something you can do yourself is asking for upward feedback using a typeform/googleform. Send these questions to your team and see where you're at:
    
    - My teamlead regularly gives me actionable feedback that helps me improve my performance.
    - My teamlead does not micromanage (i.e., get involved in details that should be handled at other levels).
    - My teamlead regularly shares relevant info and/or insights from the MT.
    - My teamlead is easy to approach with problems/concerns/feedback.
    - My teamlead communicates clear goals for our team.
    - My teamlead keeps the team focus on our priority results/deliverables/OKR?s.

Content: Don't wait for a review cycle or contract which expires to give this a thought.
    
- Optional: **Skip level session and upward feedback**
    
    **Skip level session:** 
    
    Also called an upward feedback session. A session where your team members sit down with your lead to talk about you. Your lead makes notes and shares them with you afterwords. 
    
    ?If you?re a manager of managers, you need to make sure that everyone on your team feels they can criticize their boss,? Scott says. But she?s quick to note that this does not mean encouraging your team to be boss killers. Instead, she recommends putting this advice into practice with a simple meeting ? commonly called a 'skip-level meeting,' though that sounds hierarchical, so she prefers to call them 'manager guidance sessions.'
    
    The process is straightforward: First, let your managers know that you?ll be scheduling a meeting with their direct reports. Get them comfortable with the idea, and make it clear that this meeting is intended to be helpful to them. Then explain the process to the reports, again making it clear that the goal of the meeting is to help their boss be a better manager ? and that the meeting is not for attribution.

Content: # Leading Feedback

We can not stress enough how we value feedback in all its forms.?*Good feedback is at the center of all people-related topics**. Good feedback is the key to a good collaboration, happy people and even a successful company. As a lead, you are responsible for leading the feedback for your people. This section will help you do so. Look at this list as a toolkit for you and your colleagues. 

[Our Feedback Process](Our%20Feedback%20Process%20c40fc80d546045ffb7076797301e81a8.md)

- **Make notes**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Well, because you forget. Plus making notes forces you to constantly think about the feedback. We would recommend making it a habit at the end of the week (weekly review ftw!): how did X do? 
    
    If you have a good system, it will also allow you to look back. ?Didn?t we discuss this already a year ago? It?s still an issue?. It also shows that you don?t forget and take this seriously.
    
    **How?**
    
    Docs, Evernote, Todoist, Wunderlist, Word, Things or even a notebook (I would not recommend a notebook). Whatever works. Just make small notes: You did well on project X and meeting Y, because ABC. I really liked when you did X, because it had an effect on ABC. It helps you during the reviews every 6 months.

Content: # Culture & Role-Modelling

This might be a given but we think it is so important that we dedicated a section to it: the soft shit. Everything that is not concrete or directly work-related, but is as important.  

- **Vision, mission and strategy**
    
    For people at Blendle, it's really important to know why they are doing what they do and what the effect or impact is. You probably constantly think and talk about why and how we do things. Don't forget that your team members often don't have that context. Here are two things to close that gap of information and context.
    
    - **Proactively share what was discussed in high-level meetings.** Also what did we decide not to do and how was the decision made (based on hypotheses or data?).
    - **Ask your team** if they know **why they are doing** what they're doing. Remind them of it if you feel the need.
- **Vibe and morale**
    
    Working in a nice and vibrant environment is important to all of us. A place where people are motivated, willing and positive. Do not underestimate the importance of this and the impact it can have on the daily work. Two things you can do:
    
    - Make it a recurring agenda point during retrospectives: how was the vibe during this sprint?
    - Address it if you feel morale is fading. It can be a red flag. Is it one person? One situation? One team? One project? Or is it more?
    
- **Culture**

FINAL ANSWER:","It is important to proactively share information from high-level meetings to provide transparency and ensure that team members have the necessary context and understanding of the organization's vision, mission, and strategy.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: Where can I find the job profiles and expectations for different roles?
=========
Content: - What does good performance and success look like for this person? What do you expect from him/her?
    - What challenges or downsides does this role have?
    - What would you call the role? Is it an existing role (if yes: think if you can use someone as a blueprint, if no: make sure to check if our job title matches with other companies).
    - How much experience do you think this person needs? What kind and type of experience? In what kind and type of environments? Do you expect this person to be plug and play or is there room for learning and growing?
    - What could someone's career path look like at Blendle? What do we have to offer there?
    - Do you expect this person to lead a team or guild in a way?
    - What would a average week look like for this person?
    - What are examples of projects that were there the last quarter which could have been done by the new hire? What projects or topics are coming up?
    - What kind of skills, knowledge, expertise or experience does this person need? Make a distinction between must-haves and nice-to-haves. Be specific.
    - What kind of skills are lacking in the current team which this new person should bring?
    - Selling points: why would someone quit his job for this role? Think about the team, the role and Blendle.

    **When pinning down the profile, keep [the Matrix?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=1890661785) and Work, Drive and Fit in mind. That's also what your hiring team is going to rate the candidates on, so it's good to know what they have to be rating.** 
    
    If it's a new role, it can be hard to pin these questions down. You can use this set of questions to ask experts in the field to help you pin down the profile as described in the section '[Getting people in'](https://www.notion.so/beae540c6eb54f87b43bb2123d50f23e) section 3: Sourcing:
    
    > Source to pin down your profile. New roles can be hard to pin down in a few bullet points. Since we can only hire (or turn down) someone if we know exactly what we are looking for, sourcing can be a good addition. Make a list of 20 people who match your profile so far on paper, ask your top 5 if they would like to have a cup of coffee with you. Use those conversations to finish your profile.

Content: Overall work questions:
    
    What was your biggest achievement at your former job? 
    
    What kind of things do you really dislike to do? Why? 
    
    What is your biggest mistake over the past year? What happened and how did you deal with it?
    
    You get to organise an event, which two/three people in your field of expertise would you invite to give a talk?
    
    What are your go-to platforms for staying up to date?
    
    What do you think your first 30 days would look like in this role?
    
    *Now try tailoring some questions to the profile you're looking for.*
    
    For example for PM's:
    
    What do you think Blendle's 3 most important metrics are?
    
    If you could make one change to Blendle's new iOS app, what would you change?
    
    What do you think of the current proposition?
    
    Do you communicate differently with designers than you do with engineers? What?s the difference?
    
    Can you give an example of a time where you had a hard time working with your team and how you fixed that?
    
    **Drive questions** (these apply to all roles)
    
    What makes you get up out of bed every morning? What makes you tick?
    
    If you would have your own company, what would it do/make/create?
    
    What kind of topics are you really passionate about? Sport, economics... 
    
    If you had no financial incentive (because you won the lottery) to work, how would you spend your days?

Content: - **Classic figures:** age, experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise.
        
        This is a bit old school, but also at Blendle there is a difference between someone who is 20 years of age with no experience or 30 with 8 years experience. For some jobs/roles we need certain skills, expertise or even education. This always comes with a price tag. 
        
    - **Scarcity & market value**
        
        It's fair to say that is harder to find an iOS engineer than an HR officer. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.
        
    - **Role and responsibilities**
        
        Certain roles and people make more impact then others. This is reflected in pay.
        
    - **Actual impact and contribution**
        
        Since we don't really like job titles, it's good to look at someones actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? 
        
    - **Someone's starting point**
        
        If we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.
        
    
    *Note: all of this is not an exact science and is determined together, so please: ask for help.*
    
    2**. Call candidate** with the good news. Really sell the story

QUESTION: What happens on the first day at Blendle?
=========
Content: # Your 1st month

Hey you! Welcome to Blendle. Buckle up, you're in for one hell of a ride :). 

The faster you get settled in the better, so we came up with a structure for your first month to make sure you have a smooth start.

- **Structure 1st month**
    
    Your first month is officially your trial period, which means both parties can terminate the contract if we figure out it is a total mismatch. In Blendle history, this happened once. Your first month is **not** an extended hiring process. As you might have noticed, the hiring process was pretty thorough and you made it through. This means we are pretty sure this is a good match. But, life happens so it's good to have a safeguard like the trial period, just don't feel any extra pressure plz.
    
    - **Before day 1:** your contract is signed and all the administrative stuff is taken care of. After that you got your on-boarding e-mail which probably led you here. This e-mail contains all the basic knowledge and acces codes to get you going.
    - **Day 1:** **Start** around 10:00 (depending on your team, check with them), receive your laptop and Blendle stuff, get settled in (where is the toilet, how does the coffee machine work). Your buddy will get you started in terms of work.

Content: # History

It's the **28th of April 2014**, the day Blendle was born. Marten and Alexander expected a few friends and partners to show up in an old warehouse in Amsterdam for their 'launch' party. 30 minutes before the start, the room filled with cameras and reporters. More then enough people were interested to see and hear what they came up with. Even PowNews sent a reporter:

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

A little rewind: in 2011, Marten found himself in a bookstore, a bit frustrated, looking at a magazine (as reenacted beautifully in this picture below). He was frustrated that he had to buy the whole magazine, whereas he only wanted to read one article from it. The first idea for Blendle was born and was called MyMagazine. He started talking to a lot of people in the media world, including Alexander. Alexander wasn't convinced yet.

![History%20a51acfa8132146a69ffa5d6718fdb33a/marten.jpg](History%20a51acfa8132146a69ffa5d6718fdb33a/marten.jpg)

In **mid-2012**, Marten asked Jort to make the first sketches and wireframes. 

**June 2012**, these are the first sketches of Blendle:

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: What types of expenses are covered under the study budget?
=========
Content: ## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how. Does this fit in someones personal development path at Blendle? Does it match the personal goals? Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

A good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own. The rest is common sense.

As leads you can decide to say Yes or No to budget requests based on the above questions. If you need help deciding, you can discuss with HR.

**?0-?250** = no study contract. Like a cool book, online course or a ticket to a summit.

**?250-1500 =** 12 months study contract. Like a full blown study/course or a conference (abroad).

**?1500** = edge case with 24 months study contract, please discuss with HR.

Content: # Party and study budget

There is money and time you can spend on celebrating stuff and for learning and development. We want you, as a Team Lead, to feel free to spend this money and time within these boundaries so you don't need permission every time you spend it on these two topics. We want to create clarity so you have the liberty?o spend money on this. We don't want to limit your thinking by coming up with a budget, so feel free to ask HR if you'd like to bend the budgets for a good reason.

You are in the lead for these two topics for your team. 

## Party budget

Apart from the Blendle-wide parties, outings and celebrations, we came up with a number for you to spend on team related stuff. **Every person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on fun stuff.** Why not ?80 or ?20? No good reason, we figured you could go out for dinner twice with your team for ?60. Every person keeps track of this for themselves.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: Are there any resources available to help new hires find housing in Utrecht?
=========
Content: - It's important to inform the candidates about the (lack of) housing in Utrecht, be realistic.
- We offer a relocation packages which can be customised within some boundries.
- IND requires a certain amount of income from the migrants. The amounts can be [found here](https://ind.nl/en/Pages/required-amounts-income_requirement.aspx#Application_residence_permit_highly_skilled_migrant_and_EU_blue_card).
- New hires can be eligible for the [30% ruling](https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/living/take-care-of-official-matters/highly-skilled-migrants/thirty-percent-ruling) for the duration of 5 years. They can consult [this page](https://thetax.nl/?year=2019&startFrom=Year&salary=36000&allowance=0&socialSecurity=1&retired=0&ruling=0&rulingChoice=normal) for a general calculation of the 30% ruling.

Entrance code: [here](https://www.notion.so/8354943cbce846e086ad48e67dc153bc)

You can park your car [here](http://www.parkeren-utrecht.nl/parkeergarage-moreelsepark). Our Office Manager will get you a parking card asap (if you plan to come by car often). Until then, you can get a get-out-of-parking-stamp with her. Blendle will pay for it.

Or just come by train, we?ll get you a fancy NS business card.

When you enter on your first day, it?s probably best to team up with your teammate/buddy and sit next to or near him or her. Just know that you?re free to sit anywhere you like. Just know that further to the back (behind the meeting rooms) we like to keep things quiet. Just to keep focus :). To improve focus we have one rule called the headphone-rule. Headphones on means ""do not disturb"". Pretty straight-forward, but it works.

Content: ### Where to start

We can basically hire anyone from anywhere in the world. But the migration and relocation procedure will be different for some countries. It's good to know that the migration procedure and relocation can take up to 8 weeks. So when interviewing a new candidate, that should be something to be aware of.  The information below should give you a good idea of what the differences are between different countries. 

As a lead, if you want to move forward with a candidate and make an offer, please contact HR for support first. In general the procedure looks like something like this:

1. There is a green light after the pair session;
2. Contact HR to discuss the salary, startdate and the relocation offer. In some cases HR needs to contact EMG in advance to check some legal stuff;
3. You have a ""yes"" from our candidate? HR can take over from here and will start the procedure with EMG;
4. HR will keep you up to date and help you with the on-boarding;
5. HR needs to be up to date about renewals or any other significant changes in salary or contract. These things have consequences for the work permit of our new colleague.

## Some important reminders

- It can take up to 8 weeks before a new hire can actually start working at Blendle.
- It's important to inform the candidates about the (lack of) housing in Utrecht, be realistic.
- We offer a relocation packages which can be customised within some boundries.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

QUESTION: How does the company handle employee terminations?
=========
Content: ## **What you can expect from HR**

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.
Source: Notion_DB\Blendle's Employee Handbook a834d55573614857a48a9ce9ec4194e3\Blendle Social Code 1178dd7f18cf49cea04bf9efcb2d84b2\Sexual harassment 69bffcbdaa6e4440b66be1239446c854.md

Content: Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behavior is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn?t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions.

If you suspect that someone doesn?t realize their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when:

- Your lead, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.

Content: # Firing

Saying goodbye to Blendle (from a colleague) and to a colleague (from Blendle) is a very normal and natural thing. When done right, it can even be a beautiful thing. 

We advise you to read the backdrop below first, but feel free to jump in right away with the 'Here's what you can do'-section :). General note: you do not have to do this alone, so please ask for advice and help!

- **Backdrop**
    
    Saying goodbye to Blendle (from a colleague) and to a colleague (from Blendle) is a very normal and natural thing. When done right, it can even be a beautiful thing.
    
    Saying goodbye to people is also an important part of keeping your team on the right track. Firing can even be a part of your [Personnel Planning](Hiring%20fd6a5e1f88dd4476988147a3a62e1f0d.md). The most common situation will be when you think someone is no longer a good match with Blendle for whatever reason. This doesn't happen overnight, so try to spot situations where this is happening. 
    
    To make things clear: HR and Rick and Alex will help you with this, but we want this to be on your agenda. HR will take care of the process and paper- and legal work. Rick and Alex will help with the tough conversations. **The most important work happens months before that and that's where you come in.**
    
    Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :).

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility.

    Sure, you are interviewing this person and it's your goal to be able to judge this person, but it's crucial you do this very subtly. Here are a few tips that might help.
    
    - **Let go of the structure.** Your a human, not a pre-programmed robot ;). Let the conversation happen and use the structure as a compass to make sure you cover everything. The most practical tip is to leave room for questions or to simply start explaining something from your side (just how you would do it when you're having a beer with someone). Try to feed information, even when you asked the questions up front and leave room for a question after that.

QUESTION: How much money can I spend on team-related stuff?
=========
Content: # Party and study budget

There is money and time you can spend on celebrating stuff and for learning and development. We want you, as a Team Lead, to feel free to spend this money and time within these boundaries so you don't need permission every time you spend it on these two topics. We want to create clarity so you have the liberty?o spend money on this. We don't want to limit your thinking by coming up with a budget, so feel free to ask HR if you'd like to bend the budgets for a good reason.

You are in the lead for these two topics for your team. 

## Party budget

Apart from the Blendle-wide parties, outings and celebrations, we came up with a number for you to spend on team related stuff. **Every person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on fun stuff.** Why not ?80 or ?20? No good reason, we figured you could go out for dinner twice with your team for ?60. Every person keeps track of this for themselves.  

## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in.""

Content: ## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how. Does this fit in someones personal development path at Blendle? Does it match the personal goals? Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

A good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own. The rest is common sense.

As leads you can decide to say Yes or No to budget requests based on the above questions. If you need help deciding, you can discuss with HR.

**?0-?250** = no study contract. Like a cool book, online course or a ticket to a summit.

**?250-1500 =** 12 months study contract. Like a full blown study/course or a conference (abroad).

**?1500** = edge case with 24 months study contract, please discuss with HR.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known.

QUESTION: What is the mentality expected from employees at Blendle?
=========
Content: - **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let?s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.
- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn?t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.
- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don?t forget to include praise. Let?s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.
- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:
    
    Are you giving regular feedback?
    
    Are you giving praise?
    
    Are you actively challenging your team?
    
    Are you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?
    
    Are you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?
    
    Is your schedule (and that of your team) in a healthy rhythm (work-life balance)? You set the example.
    
    Is your team taking regular holidays/long weekends?

Content: # Intro: two things you should know

When working at Blendle, there are a few things you should know. Not to scare you. It is just something to be aware of.

## **1. Blendle is a startup**

Blendle is a startup. Your salary (and all benefits) is paid from money from investors. You (and the people you work with) are part of the solution to the problem we are trying to solve. Time lost or wasted is bad, because it doesn?t bring us closer to the goal: supporting quality journalism. We need money to do so. Finding the right product-market fit (building a freaking beautiful product which the whole world wants to use) and becoming profitable is crucial to reaching the end goal.

We tend to say to people (imagine a smile on our face): ?Hey, but no pressure!?, and then we both start to laugh (or else it is awkward). Well let me say this once, loud and clear: we realise that there is pressure. It can be pretty intense. This is not a regular corporate day job, and that has its up- and downsides. Example upside: we don?t care where and when you work, which means flexibility. Example downside: you have to be able to regulate yourself, which can be hard.

There are a lot of product/business choices made because of this survival mode. Some you might like (a lot of freedom and responsibility in your work), some you might dislike (pressure on shipping, for example). **Bottom line: survival mode results in a fast-paced, high-pressure, sometimes hectic/chaotic environment.**

QUESTION: What are the challenges Blendle faces in hiring diverse profiles?
=========
Content: - We believe being **inclusive** is important because it **fits our core values** of wanting to be a great place to work and really caring for each other. A place where people feel welcome and can be themselves. Inclusivity is crucial to our work environment and culture.
- We have trouble hiring diverse profiles. We noticed no flaws in the hiring process which would lead to favour a certain type of profile. We did notice that the 'pools' in which we are hiring (journalism and tech) are dominated by a certain profile which could explain this trend.
- We have open-minded people at Blendle who are willing and are becoming more aware.

**Some observations**:

- We tend to speak in Dutch in social settings. It can easily make non-Dutch people uncomfortable. We should speak English.
- The way we work (especially in meetings) suits extravert people better then introvert people.
- There is not a lot of variation on standard diversity variables like political views, religion, age, ethnicity, gender and educational background. Again, partly explained by the field we're in.
- Most of the leaders at Blendle are male.
- There is equal pay between men and women in the same role.
- We believe aiming for diversity numbers narrows the conversation on the topic for now. We decided to use the data to feed the conversation but not implement quotas.

**What we do:**

Content: # Diversity and Inclusion

It was this ^^ picture from our Christmas party three years ago which got us some replies on Twitter. A lot of males and a lot of white. We know that we need to do better to make Blendle a more diverse workplace. We spend a lot of time thinking about diversity and inclusion. After reading, talking and listening, we learned a few things:

- This is a sensitive topic: feelings and opinions are involved.
- This is a trending topic: there is a lot of noise and it's hard to pin down the essence.
- This is not a new, but renewed topic.
- Diversity and inclusion is more of a scale than a simple yes or no statement.
- Everyone is biased and every company is at risk of becoming less diverse and inclusive.
- A more diverse and inclusive company **>** a less diverse and inclusive company for a lot of reasons.
- Diversity and inclusion is not 'just' about gender or race, so looking at just those numbers can limit your thoughts on this topic. The practical side of this topic is also way more subtle.

**Diversity and inclusion at Blendle**

What we know now:

- We believe in the importance of a **diverse** team because we believe **it's crucial to our succes and product.** We try to add meaning to peoples everyday life by helping them reach quality content instead of cat gifs on Facebook. This can only be done by a group of people with different backgrounds, expertise, personalities, talents, ideas and opinions.

Content: # Hiring

Getting new people to join Blendle is a **high effort, high impact** thing to do. The reward is huge, when you see the people you hired adding value to the company. Imagine not hiring that person: that new idea, design, piece of code, algorithm or audio show would not have been there. Your hire could be key to the succes of Blendle: that's a lot of impact. The other side of the same coin is that it's high effort too. These 4 pointers will help you get started. 

- **Personnel planning**
    
    Planning the number and type of people you need in the future is hard but also crucial. Hiring people takes time (~3 months), so looking ahead is important for making your projects succeed. Without the right (number of) people, it's hard to build a cool product.
    
    When making plans for **the coming and next quarter:**
    
    1. **Determine what work needs to be done, looking 6-12 months ahead, and decide if we have enough resources to do so.** 
        
        Our basic premise is that we work with the team we have and we hire reactively. But ask yourself a few questions. Do you have the right number and type of people? What kind of skills, expertise, experience do you need in what amount? What can we fix internally? What can we teach the people who are at Blendle? What can we just try with advice from outside? Is your ask temporary or permanent? How is the current workload? Can we afford to ship less quickly?

QUESTION: What variables are needed to plan for hiring at Blendle?
=========
Content: # Hiring

Getting new people to join Blendle is a **high effort, high impact** thing to do. The reward is huge, when you see the people you hired adding value to the company. Imagine not hiring that person: that new idea, design, piece of code, algorithm or audio show would not have been there. Your hire could be key to the succes of Blendle: that's a lot of impact. The other side of the same coin is that it's high effort too. These 4 pointers will help you get started. 

- **Personnel planning**
    
    Planning the number and type of people you need in the future is hard but also crucial. Hiring people takes time (~3 months), so looking ahead is important for making your projects succeed. Without the right (number of) people, it's hard to build a cool product.
    
    When making plans for **the coming and next quarter:**
    
    1. **Determine what work needs to be done, looking 6-12 months ahead, and decide if we have enough resources to do so.** 
        
        Our basic premise is that we work with the team we have and we hire reactively. But ask yourself a few questions. Do you have the right number and type of people? What kind of skills, expertise, experience do you need in what amount? What can we fix internally? What can we teach the people who are at Blendle? What can we just try with advice from outside? Is your ask temporary or permanent? How is the current workload? Can we afford to ship less quickly?

- **Blendle outings:** 
the party agenda is pretty full. You?ll be invited when there is a party ahead.
- **Flexible Holidays:**

- **Flexible hours**: 
we want you to find out what works for you best. Just know that we don't keep track of hours. We trust you.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

- Don?t save all your feedback up - give at the time of the event (or shortly after) -  There should be no surprises
- Don't make it personal.  Focus on the situation not the person. and how you can work together to improve it for next time.
- Examples are fine, but don't use them for the blame game.
- Reflect on your intention in giving someone your feedback. Are you giving it to help someone or to shame someone?  Did you have a role in the situation that happened?
- Be clear and direct, subtle gibberish doesn't help anyone.
- Remember A-P-P-R-E-C-I-A-T-I-O-N helps motivate and shows people their unique value.

<aside>
? Tips for r**eceiving feedback**

</aside>

- Always assume feedback is given to help you
- Be open to listening and don't get stuck in a spiral of defending or pointing fingers back.
Take responsibility if something went wrong and focus on learning how to work together better.
- Be curious - Why is this feedback given to you? What is really at the root of it?  Is it the feedback itself that indicates a problem or is some emotion underlying it that needs to be addressed?

Content: - **Continuous Feedback**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Don?t save up feedback, it?s less powerful. Just speak your mind. The more often you do this, the easier it gets. This goes both ways: good and bad. I never heard someone say he or she got too much feedback.
    
    **How?** 
    
    Face to face is best (e-mail/slack/chat is ok for practical stuff).
    
    Praise in public, feedback 1on1.
    
    Think about:
    
    - quality of work: you did well on X. Because ABC.
    - way of working: you were slow and distracted, how can I help?
    - behaviour: try not to interrupt people during the meeting.
    
    There are a lot of tips out there on how to give feedback.
    
    I like the HIP-approach:
    
    - **H**umble
    - **H**elpful
    - **I**mmediate
    - **I**n person
    - **P**rivate criticism/ **P**ublic Praise
    - Not about **P**ersonality
    
    Source:
    
    [A HIP Approach to Feedback | Achieve Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/a-hip-approach-to-feedback/)
    
- **Have scheduled (bi-)weekly 1on1's**
    
    **Why?**
    
    It?s important and it's not going to happen if you don?t schedule it. If all is fine it might feel too much. It isn?t. Goal is to ?stay in touch? and simply have a relationship with someone. The relationship is the basis for being able to give good feedback and it makes it easier to receive too.
    
    **How?**

Content: # Leading Feedback

We can not stress enough how we value feedback in all its forms.?*Good feedback is at the center of all people-related topics**. Good feedback is the key to a good collaboration, happy people and even a successful company. As a lead, you are responsible for leading the feedback for your people. This section will help you do so. Look at this list as a toolkit for you and your colleagues. 

[Our Feedback Process](Our%20Feedback%20Process%20c40fc80d546045ffb7076797301e81a8.md)

- **Make notes**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Well, because you forget. Plus making notes forces you to constantly think about the feedback. We would recommend making it a habit at the end of the week (weekly review ftw!): how did X do? 
    
    If you have a good system, it will also allow you to look back. ?Didn?t we discuss this already a year ago? It?s still an issue?. It also shows that you don?t forget and take this seriously.
    
    **How?**
    
    Docs, Evernote, Todoist, Wunderlist, Word, Things or even a notebook (I would not recommend a notebook). Whatever works. Just make small notes: You did well on project X and meeting Y, because ABC. I really liked when you did X, because it had an effect on ABC. It helps you during the reviews every 6 months.

Content: Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :). 
    

## Here's what you can do:

1. Actively **think** about the possibility that someone's time at Blendle is up. At least every month for everyone in your team.
2. **Flag** this at HR/MT when that happens. 
3. **Ask** for help if needed already at this stage.
4. **Analyse** (maybe together) the problem and give feedback to the person in question: try to get on the same page about where things go 'wrong'. These are pointers which might steer your thoughts. Real situations are always more complex. 
    - Someone is **underperforming**. Try using [the Matrix?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=0) to track down the areas where you think things should improve. Give actionable feedback and try to come up with concrete points to work on in his/her personal goals. Don't wait for the feedback cycle, the time is always now.
    - Someone **stopped growing or learning**. This isn't necessarily an immediate problem, but it can be because most people like working at Blendle because they grow and learn so much. Someone standing still for a year is a red flag.

FINAL ANSWER:","When receiving feedback, individuals should focus on being open to listening, avoiding defensiveness, and taking responsibility for any mistakes. They should also be curious about the root of the feedback and whether there are underlying emotions that need to be addressed. Additionally, individuals should reflect on their intention in giving feedback and ensure that it is given to help rather than shame someone. Finally, individuals should focus on the situation rather than the person and work together to improve for the future.

QUESTION: Does Blendle provide relocation assistance to highly skilled migrants?
=========
Content: # Highly Skilled Migrants and relocation

Blendle has been a [""recognised sponsor""](https://ind.nl/en/Forms/3084.pdf) by IND sinds 2018. This means we are allowed to employ highly skilled knowledge migrants and relocate them to the Netherlands.

Blendle offers highly skilled migrants a great relocation package and compensations. For the migration and relocation part, Blendle works with [Expat Management Group](https://www.expatmanagementgroup.com/). EMG has a dedicated team involved for the coordination and assistance in immigration, relocation and tax services.

## Blendle Relocation package

- We take care of the work- and residence permits and all the fees (children and spouse included).
- We book the flight(s) to the Netherlands.
- We pay an extra relocation fee to help with the extra expenses.
- We arrange and pay for the first month of temporary accommodation.
- We assist with permanent housing. Like helping with the search, negotiations and settling in.
- We assist with the 30% ruling tax application.

What we offer is flexible and can be adjusted to certain personal needs. But we highly recommend to stick with this all-in-one package to reduce any hassle and stress when relocating to the Netherlands.

Content: ### Where to start

We can basically hire anyone from anywhere in the world. But the migration and relocation procedure will be different for some countries. It's good to know that the migration procedure and relocation can take up to 8 weeks. So when interviewing a new candidate, that should be something to be aware of.  The information below should give you a good idea of what the differences are between different countries. 

As a lead, if you want to move forward with a candidate and make an offer, please contact HR for support first. In general the procedure looks like something like this:

1. There is a green light after the pair session;
2. Contact HR to discuss the salary, startdate and the relocation offer. In some cases HR needs to contact EMG in advance to check some legal stuff;
3. You have a ""yes"" from our candidate? HR can take over from here and will start the procedure with EMG;
4. HR will keep you up to date and help you with the on-boarding;
5. HR needs to be up to date about renewals or any other significant changes in salary or contract. These things have consequences for the work permit of our new colleague.

## Some important reminders

- It can take up to 8 weeks before a new hire can actually start working at Blendle.
- It's important to inform the candidates about the (lack of) housing in Utrecht, be realistic.
- We offer a relocation packages which can be customised within some boundries.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more.

We can do this.

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things.

- Optional: **Skip level session and upward feedback**
    
    **Skip level session:** 
    
    Also called an upward feedback session. A session where your team members sit down with your lead to talk about you. Your lead makes notes and shares them with you afterwords. 
    
    ?If you?re a manager of managers, you need to make sure that everyone on your team feels they can criticize their boss,? Scott says. But she?s quick to note that this does not mean encouraging your team to be boss killers. Instead, she recommends putting this advice into practice with a simple meeting ? commonly called a 'skip-level meeting,' though that sounds hierarchical, so she prefers to call them 'manager guidance sessions.'
    
    The process is straightforward: First, let your managers know that you?ll be scheduling a meeting with their direct reports. Get them comfortable with the idea, and make it clear that this meeting is intended to be helpful to them. Then explain the process to the reports, again making it clear that the goal of the meeting is to help their boss be a better manager ? and that the meeting is not for attribution.

    - My teamlead regularly gives me actionable feedback that helps me improve my performance.
    - My teamlead does not micromanage (i.e., get involved in details that should be handled at other levels).
    - My teamlead regularly shares relevant info and/or insights from the MT.
    - My teamlead is easy to approach with problems/concerns/feedback.
    - My teamlead communicates clear goals for our team.
    - My teamlead keeps the team focus on our priority results/deliverables/OKR?s.

    **Why?** 
    
    Don?t save up feedback, it?s less powerful. Just speak your mind. The more often you do this, the easier it gets. This goes both ways: good and bad. I never heard someone say he or she got too much feedback.
    
    **How?** 
    
    Face to face is best (e-mail/slack/chat is ok for practical stuff).
    
    Praise in public, feedback 1on1.
    
    Think about:
    
    - quality of work: you did well on X. Because ABC.
    - way of working: you were slow and distracted, how can I help?
    - behaviour: try not to interrupt people during the meeting.
    
    There are a lot of tips out there on how to give feedback.
    
    I like the HIP-approach:
    
    - **H**umble
    - **H**elpful
    - **I**mmediate
    - **I**n person
    - **P**rivate criticism/ **P**ublic Praise

- **Have scheduled (bi-)weekly 1on1's**
    
    **Why?**
    
    It?s important and it's not going to happen if you don?t schedule it. If all is fine it might feel too much. It isn?t. Goal is to ?stay in touch? and simply have a relationship with someone. The relationship is the basis for being able to give good feedback and it makes it easier to receive too.

FINAL ANSWER:","A skip level session or upward feedback session is a meeting where team members sit down with their lead to provide feedback about their manager. The lead takes notes during the session and shares them with the manager afterwards. The purpose of these sessions is to help the manager improve their management skills. It is important for managers of managers to create an environment where team members feel comfortable criticizing their boss. These sessions can be called skip level meetings or manager guidance sessions. The feedback provided in these sessions is not attributed to specific individuals. Additionally, upward feedback can also be obtained through surveys or questionnaires sent to team members to assess their satisfaction with their team lead. It is recommended to provide continuous feedback and have regular one-on-one meetings with team members to maintain open communication and build relationships.

You can park your car [here](http://www.parkeren-utrecht.nl/parkeergarage-moreelsepark). Our Office Manager will get you a parking card asap (if you plan to come by car often). Until then, you can get a get-out-of-parking-stamp with her. Blendle will pay for it.

Or just come by train, we?ll get you a fancy NS business card.

When you enter on your first day, it?s probably best to team up with your teammate/buddy and sit next to or near him or her. Just know that you?re free to sit anywhere you like. Just know that further to the back (behind the meeting rooms) we like to keep things quiet. Just to keep focus :). To improve focus we have one rule called the headphone-rule. Headphones on means ""do not disturb"". Pretty straight-forward, but it works.

More practical information about our office and door lock can be found [**here](General%20&%20practical%20b2682126db8e47bf8e5fabb8b5b4c1ce.md)**

Every week on Wednesday from 12.30-16.00h (might change, see the all@ calendar), we have a masseuse come by to relieve us from stress (what stress), RSI, that aching back or tiredness. And yes its great! There is no queue, just a free-for-all.

Content: # Bike parking Utrecht

We like to compensate for the lack of good bike parking space around our office. That?s why Blendle will pay for your [U-stall yearly subscription](https://www.u-stal.nl/) (these are not NS parkings, but from Gemeente).

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: What platform does Blendle use to create and edit job descriptions?
=========
Content: 1. Ask HR to duplicate a template for you and make you hiring manager or reuse an existing job description and go from there. 
    2. Go to edit:
        
        ![Hiring%20fd6a5e1f88dd4476988147a3a62e1f0d/Schermafbeelding2018-07-10om13.11.25.png](Hiring%20fd6a5e1f88dd4476988147a3a62e1f0d/Schermafbeelding2018-07-10om13.11.25.png)
        
    3. Adjust the job description to your liking:
        - The first section is about the team, what they do and the reason why we are hiring.
        - The second section consists of the 4-5 reasons we chose to work at Blendle. You can alter them, but you can keep those the same.
        - The third section is our wishlist: alter these to get the most important stuff from your intake (above) across.
        - The last step is altering the Application form (click 'Application form' next to 'Job post').
            
            ![Hiring%20fd6a5e1f88dd4476988147a3a62e1f0d/Schermafbeelding2018-07-10om13.15.50.png](Hiring%20fd6a5e1f88dd4476988147a3a62e1f0d/Schermafbeelding2018-07-10om13.15.50.png)
            
            The section 'Questions' is most important for now. Make sure to come up with a few good job-related questions based on your intake. For example for Android dev: 'Tell us about the app you have in the store :)'. Be creative: a good question tells you a lot more than a well-designed resume.

> At Blendle we value the **Freedom** and **Responsibility** of giving **Proactive** and **Honest** feedback to drive excellent **Team Work**.   We try to build input points into everything we do.  We even got feedback on upgrading our Feedback process - all of which is incorporated into the new process below.
> 

# **Typical Feedback Moments @ Blendle:**

- **Sprint retro** - every 2 weeks.  How did the cycle go?  What did we learn? How did we feel?
- **Agile Process retro** - Monthly.  How can we improve the process and collaboration?
- **BIG HR People Surve**y - two times a year Q1 and Q4 on Employee experience.
- **EVERYDAY!**

# The **Quarterly Coaching Feedback Process**

At least every Quarter we want to make sure you get a formal feedback and coaching conversation focused on your personal and professional development, and progress.  And luckily, the quarterly process aligns to the timing of our Objectives Goals Strategies Measures, so you can chat about both with your manager at the same time.

### The Process:

**YOU** run ***your*** process - End to End.  By having full ownership you control your development (that ****responsible** value again ?) and focus on **teamwork** **and ****honesty ****by discussing feedback together (rather than through your manager).  So you're developing from the development process itself!

Content: We know this adds to your tally. Again, just becoming aware of this already helps.

And also again, when you see something causing a lot of stress, let?s get to work on it. Not digging the new team structure? Not feeling your current role? Not happy with your team lead? Bring it up with someone you trust (HR, your team lead, Alexander, just anyone) and let?s try to fix it or at least talk about it.

Blendle cares. We care. So if you?re struggling, let?s change things to make sure you are happy, healthy and at your best.

# 3. Make changes: here are some quick wins

- **Look at your work life balance**
    
    
    > In engineering, people talk about asset integrity, which means that you service the machinery before it breaks. In modern organizations, the work is thinking and the machinery is your brain. We know from cognitive science that there are hard limits to what the brain can deal with. And yet, there?s an awful lot in the way we work which flies in the face of that. We think that if we work through the night, we?re being very clever. We?re not. We think we can work long hours ? month after month, year after year ? and that there won?t be any wear and tear. But there is.

FINAL ANSWER:","The expectation for improving HR operations in the second quarter is to make a plan and come up with ideas on how to improve HR operations. This can be a one-pager with an assessment and advice. It is also important to get to know all HR/Recruitment/Office/PA processes and topics, get in charge of all HR operations, and have meetings with key figures to get to know colleagues. Additionally, getting up to speed with recruitment and implementing recruitment analytics are important tasks. The focus should be on hiring great people.

QUESTION: Can you explain how the monthly contribution to Bright Pensioen works?
=========
Content: # Pension

- **Pension:** 
we facilitate pensions via [Bright Pensioen](https://brightpensioen.nl/). Bright is not your standard pension plan. We think it?s better than the mandatory corporate pension scheme which you might be used to. [This video](https://youtu.be/xfZM2JuovJM?t=1941) explains a bit about pensions in general and it starts at the point where they explain what Bright Pensioen is and why we chose it. Blendle pays the costs to Bright, so the money you put aside goes straight to your pension. You can sign up through [THIS PAGA](https://brightpensioen.nl/werknemer/word-bright/)
You can join a webinar for more info on [https://brightpensioen.nl/event/pensioen-faciliteren/](https://brightpensioen.nl/event/pensioen-faciliteren/)
Or have a look at their (English)
    
    [Workshop Blendle ENG (3).pdf](Pension%20a20c852b7ada4be297a97951aa20a7e2/Workshop_Blendle_ENG_(3).pdf)
    
    [Pensions & Retirement age in the Netherlands](https://www.iamexpat.nl/expat-info/official-issues/pensions-retirement-netherlands)

At the moment Blendle can?t afford a full blown pension plan, but we want to do what we can. That?s why Blendle pays the costs to Bright, so the money you put aside, goes straight to your pension. I also attached a presentation Bright did at Blendle.
        - **Option plan:** there is an Option plan. Options are worth a lot for us, because it is the most precious thing we have: a part of our company. So we don?t hand them out by default, we just want you to know it?s there and that we can explain the details to you later if you want.
        - **Laptop:** a good laptop is important, so you get one from us. Special needs? Let me know.
        - **Equipment:** we have electric sit-stand-desks and good chairs so your back stays in shape and there are more than enough screens and additional equipment at the office.
        - **Massages:** once a week, our masseuse gets rid of all our stress with her chair massages.

=========
Content: ## **What you can expect from HR**

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.

Content: # Addressing harassment

You are *always* in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward when you report an incident. We encourage you to talk about what happened.

If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8). In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it?s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. 

Here are the steps you can take, either:

- **Talk to the offender**. If you suspect that an offender doesn?t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.

Content: - When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.
- When people work hard, **poke them** to take time off so they recharge.
- For longer leaves of absence (~4 weeks) ping HR for advice.

    3. Adjust the job description to your liking:

Content: - **Telephone costs/reimbursements:** if you need to make a lot of phone calls for Blendle, we?ll reimburse your costs. Same goes for other costs.
        - **Pension:** we facilitate pensions via [Bright Pensioen](https://brightpensioen.nl/). Bright is not your standard pension plan. We think it?s better than the mandatory corporate pension scheme which you might be used to. [This video](https://youtu.be/xfZM2JuovJM?t=1941) explains a bit about pensions in general and it starts at the point where they explain what Bright Pensioen is and why we chose it. At the moment Blendle can?t afford a full blown pension plan, but we want to do what we can. That?s why Blendle pays the costs to Bright, so the money you put aside, goes straight to your pension. I also attached a presentation Bright did at Blendle.
        - **Option plan:** there is an Option plan. Options are worth a lot for us, because it is the most precious thing we have: a part of our company. So we don?t hand them out by default, we just want you to know it?s there and that we can explain the details to you later if you want.
        - **Laptop:** a good laptop is important, so you get one from us. Special needs? Let me know.
        - **Equipment:** we have electric sit-stand-desks and good chairs so your back stays in shape and there are more than enough screens and additional equipment at the office.
        - **Massages:** once a week, our masseuse gets rid of all our stress with her chair massages.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: How do I report a workplace incident?
=========
Content: # Addressing harassment

You are *always* in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward when you report an incident. We encourage you to talk about what happened.

If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8). In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it?s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. 

Here are the steps you can take, either:

- **Talk to the offender**. If you suspect that an offender doesn?t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.

Content: ## **What you can expect from HR**

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.
Source: Notion_DB\Blendle's Employee Handbook a834d55573614857a48a9ce9ec4194e3\Blendle Social Code 1178dd7f18cf49cea04bf9efcb2d84b2\Sexual harassment 69bffcbdaa6e4440b66be1239446c854.md

Content: Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behavior is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn?t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions.

If you suspect that someone doesn?t realize their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when:

- Your lead, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.

Content: - **Talk to HR**. Feel free to reach out to HR in any case of harassment no matter how minor it may seem. For your safety, contact HR as soon as possible in cases of serious harassment (e.g. sexual advances) or if your team lead is involved in your claim. Anything you disclose will remain confidential.
- **Talk to a confidential counsellor**. If for any reason you don't want to talk to HR or your team lead directly, you can choose to talk to our outside counsellor. We appointed one in November 2018. The outside counsellor can listen to you and advise you on possible next steps. Again, you will always be in the lead on next steps. The content of your conversation will always stay confidential and will not reach Blendle or the offender. You can contact our counsellor directly by [email or phone (not a public link)](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8).

If you report assault to the police, Blendle will provide any possible support until the matter is resolved. In any case, we will ensure you are not victimised and that you have access to relevant evidence.

## **What's not acceptable at Blendle**

Harassment includes bullying, intimidation, direct insults, malicious gossip and victimisation. It?s impossible to create an exhaustive list, but here are some instances that we consider harassment:

- Sabotaging someone?s work on purpose
- Engaging in frequent or unwanted advances of any nature

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","To report a workplace incident, you can take the following steps:

1. Talk to the offender: If the harassment is minor, such as inappropriate jokes or comments, you can directly address the offender and try to resolve the issue.

2. Talk to your team lead: If the harassment persists or is more serious, you should inform your team lead. Provide them with as much detail as possible, including any evidence you may have.

3. Talk to HR: If you prefer not to speak directly to your team lead or if they are involved in the incident, you can reach out to HR. They will provide you with information on the disciplinary procedures and your options.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Content: **It looks weird in the system.....I see a negative balance!**
    
    For everyone with a 40 hours contract, the **minimum balance is set as 20 days** in NMBRS each year, and this re-sets at the start of each year.  In the case that you didn't take all 20 days by end of December (we hope this is not the case as you should take the advised minimum, at a minimum), these days will show in your balance for the next year for 6 months.
    
    (note: as we are introducing the tool in June 2020, the remaining balance is 10 for 2020, that's half of the normal balance)
    
    On the other hand, if **you exceed this minimum balance** you will show as negative in the system.  Nothing to worry about **-** remember... **we don't track your holidays in that kind of way**.  As long as your manager has agreed to your holidays and you have added your request, it's fine to go negative. 
    
    **How do I submit my holiday plans?**
    After discussing your time off with your lead and team, go to NMBRS to submit the request. To do so, log in to your [https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/](https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/) account and choose ""Verlof"". Fill in the dates, reason, save it and done!. Your lead will get a signal to approve the request through NMBRS.

Content: # Firing

Saying goodbye to Blendle (from a colleague) and to a colleague (from Blendle) is a very normal and natural thing. When done right, it can even be a beautiful thing. 

We advise you to read the backdrop below first, but feel free to jump in right away with the 'Here's what you can do'-section :). General note: you do not have to do this alone, so please ask for advice and help!

- **Backdrop**
    
    Saying goodbye to Blendle (from a colleague) and to a colleague (from Blendle) is a very normal and natural thing. When done right, it can even be a beautiful thing.
    
    Saying goodbye to people is also an important part of keeping your team on the right track. Firing can even be a part of your [Personnel Planning](Hiring%20fd6a5e1f88dd4476988147a3a62e1f0d.md). The most common situation will be when you think someone is no longer a good match with Blendle for whatever reason. This doesn't happen overnight, so try to spot situations where this is happening. 
    
    To make things clear: HR and Rick and Alex will help you with this, but we want this to be on your agenda. HR will take care of the process and paper- and legal work. Rick and Alex will help with the tough conversations. **The most important work happens months before that and that's where you come in.**
    
    Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :).

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Content: # Our Feedback Process

> At Blendle we value the **Freedom** and **Responsibility** of giving **Proactive** and **Honest** feedback to drive excellent **Team Work**.   We try to build input points into everything we do.  We even got feedback on upgrading our Feedback process - all of which is incorporated into the new process below.
> 

# **Typical Feedback Moments @ Blendle:**

- **Sprint retro** - every 2 weeks.  How did the cycle go?  What did we learn? How did we feel?
- **Agile Process retro** - Monthly.  How can we improve the process and collaboration?
- **BIG HR People Surve**y - two times a year Q1 and Q4 on Employee experience.
- **EVERYDAY!**

# The **Quarterly Coaching Feedback Process**

At least every Quarter we want to make sure you get a formal feedback and coaching conversation focused on your personal and professional development, and progress.  And luckily, the quarterly process aligns to the timing of our Objectives Goals Strategies Measures, so you can chat about both with your manager at the same time.

### The Process:

**YOU** run ***your*** process - End to End.  By having full ownership you control your development (that ****responsible** value again ?) and focus on **teamwork** **and ****honesty ****by discussing feedback together (rather than through your manager).  So you're developing from the development process itself!

Content: # Culture & Role-Modelling

This might be a given but we think it is so important that we dedicated a section to it: the soft shit. Everything that is not concrete or directly work-related, but is as important.  

- **Vision, mission and strategy**
    
    For people at Blendle, it's really important to know why they are doing what they do and what the effect or impact is. You probably constantly think and talk about why and how we do things. Don't forget that your team members often don't have that context. Here are two things to close that gap of information and context.
    
    - **Proactively share what was discussed in high-level meetings.** Also what did we decide not to do and how was the decision made (based on hypotheses or data?).
    - **Ask your team** if they know **why they are doing** what they're doing. Remind them of it if you feel the need.
- **Vibe and morale**
    
    Working in a nice and vibrant environment is important to all of us. A place where people are motivated, willing and positive. Do not underestimate the importance of this and the impact it can have on the daily work. Two things you can do:
    
    - Make it a recurring agenda point during retrospectives: how was the vibe during this sprint?
    - Address it if you feel morale is fading. It can be a red flag. Is it one person? One situation? One team? One project? Or is it more?
    
- **Culture**

Content: - What does good performance and success look like for this person? What do you expect from him/her?
    - What challenges or downsides does this role have?
    - What would you call the role? Is it an existing role (if yes: think if you can use someone as a blueprint, if no: make sure to check if our job title matches with other companies).
    - How much experience do you think this person needs? What kind and type of experience? In what kind and type of environments? Do you expect this person to be plug and play or is there room for learning and growing?
    - What could someone's career path look like at Blendle? What do we have to offer there?
    - Do you expect this person to lead a team or guild in a way?
    - What would a average week look like for this person?
    - What are examples of projects that were there the last quarter which could have been done by the new hire? What projects or topics are coming up?
    - What kind of skills, knowledge, expertise or experience does this person need? Make a distinction between must-haves and nice-to-haves. Be specific.
    - What kind of skills are lacking in the current team which this new person should bring?
    - Selling points: why would someone quit his job for this role? Think about the team, the role and Blendle.
    
    Share this with the hiring team, so everybody is on the same page on what we are looking for.

FINAL ANSWER:","The performance evaluation process within our organization includes several feedback moments, such as sprint retros, agile process retros, and a biannual HR survey. Additionally, there is a quarterly coaching feedback process that involves completing a self-assessment, gathering 360 feedback from colleagues and managers, clarifying feedback through discussions, and setting up a coaching session with the manager to agree on a development plan. The process is designed to give employees ownership of their development and promote teamwork and honesty in feedback discussions. There are also tips provided for giving useful feedback. The organization also emphasizes the importance of culture and role-modeling, including sharing information from high-level meetings, addressing morale and vibe during retrospectives, and promoting a positive and motivated work environment. In terms of hiring, the organization suggests considering the expectations for good performance and success, the challenges and downsides of the role, the necessary experience and skills, and the potential career path at Blendle. It is important to share this information with the hiring team to ensure alignment.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22.

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things.

- **Get people in**
    
    We discuss how to get people in right here: 
    
    [Notion - The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases.](https://www.notion.so/blendle/Getting-people-in-sourcing-beae540c6eb54f87b43bb2123d50f23e)
    
    There are 2 types of candidates:
    
    - People who applied (via Homerun)
    - People who were sourced by us (approached via Linkedin or e-mail).
    
    There is a different approach in the first step. 
    
- **1. Application/interest and first review/screening**
    
    **Who is responsible:** hiring manager
    
    **Who is involved:** whole hiring team
    
    **Goal:** focus on filtering on hard variables (work) to filter out the best potential candidates.
    
    **Timing follow-up:** within a week
    
    **How:**
    
    - **People who applied ? review application ? ask input hiring team ? turn down or invite/phone screen**
    - **People who were sourced ? review information ? ask input hiring team ? invite/phone screen**: we only approach people who we think are really interesting so if we approach someone and he/she is interested, we always invite them for a cup of coffee.
- ***Optional: phone screening***
    
    **Who is responsible:** hiring manager
    
    **Who is involved:** hiring manager

Content: ### Where to start

We can basically hire anyone from anywhere in the world. But the migration and relocation procedure will be different for some countries. It's good to know that the migration procedure and relocation can take up to 8 weeks. So when interviewing a new candidate, that should be something to be aware of.  The information below should give you a good idea of what the differences are between different countries. 

As a lead, if you want to move forward with a candidate and make an offer, please contact HR for support first. In general the procedure looks like something like this:

1. There is a green light after the pair session;
2. Contact HR to discuss the salary, startdate and the relocation offer. In some cases HR needs to contact EMG in advance to check some legal stuff;
3. You have a ""yes"" from our candidate? HR can take over from here and will start the procedure with EMG;
4. HR will keep you up to date and help you with the on-boarding;
5. HR needs to be up to date about renewals or any other significant changes in salary or contract. These things have consequences for the work permit of our new colleague.

## Some important reminders

- It can take up to 8 weeks before a new hire can actually start working at Blendle.
- It's important to inform the candidates about the (lack of) housing in Utrecht, be realistic.
- We offer a relocation packages which can be customised within some boundries.

        **Get to know your colleagues (have meetings with key figures).**

Content: - You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.
    - This is a guideline.  If you have other national holidays you observe (eg Eid al-Fitr Suikerfeest, ending of Ramadan) feel free to work or be off when you want.
    
    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.
    - You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.
    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.
- **Backdrop**
    
    The law and additional ruling tell us what we can and can not do according to time off. We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:

Content: When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:
    
    - **It is impossible to work 60 hours productively over a longer period of time.** It hurts you and Blendle to work that much. If you are able to work 8 productive hours a day you should be proud of that. Sometimes it will be 6, sometimes 10: relax, it?s okay, You?re not working in a factory with time stamps.
    - Be flexible. Some days you just don?t have it. **You are not a machine.** Of course, first you?ll take a walk and grab a double espresso or a Club Mate, but if that doesn?t work it?s okay. Go home. Go to the gym. Go play with your kid. Go kiting. Go for a walk in the forest. Anything, just don?t sit behind your desk to ?make the hours?. That?s not helping anybody.
    - Working at home vs. at Blendle HQ. Try to strike a **balance between home/office**. Meetings and brainstorms are best done face to face but a day of deep work is best done in a cafe or on an abandoned island with 4g.
    - **Rotate, change your pace.** During the summer it can be nice to start at 6:30 and bike to the beach at 15.00h. During the winter, every morning might feel like a small hangover and you stroll into HQ at 10:00 after your first 2 cups of coffee.
- **Take care of your body and mind**
    
    
    **Take holidays and days off.**

Content: # Office

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?le is in charge of lunch ??sk her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

**Snacks and more**

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: Could you explain the complex intricacies of our company's policies on data privacy and security?
=========
Content: People team uses this system to save and track all your personal documents and information as well. Whenever something changes, this will go through this system. You can change your contact information and address if you move. You can also always access this system to have a look at your documents, eg contract, reviews etc.

You can also send in your requests for reimbursement of business expenses and holidays.   

**Security**

We care about security. So, whenever possible (Google apps, GitHub etc): use two-factor authentication! And please turn on Full Disk Encryption (FileVault on Mac) on your computer. And of course, whether you're at the office or somewhere else,?e sure to lock your computer whenever you are AFK. And whenever you hear ?Brace, Brace!?, be sure to get yourself into brace-position. It is for your own and our safety. :-)

For sharing secure stuff with each other we use [Tresorit](https://tresorit.com/). Be sure to download that! If you need it, your team will also mention this, so don?t worry! Oh, and in case you?re wondering: we don?t share any user information via Slack or Google.

**Recruitment**

This might be one of the most important questions: Who would you like to work with? You might have noticed: we?re expanding! While trying to conquer the world, we need to gather our own army of super-duper extraterrestrial-powered heroes (you know them as your colleagues). We still have a lot of vacancies open? but apart from them, we?re always looking for new recruits. So, do you know anyone fitting the (or a) profile? Let them know we?re looking for ?em or let HR know they need to contact them.

**Business intelligence**

Sounds cool. It is. We want everybody to be informed and make the best decisions possible because all the intel is available. This is also a great way to be transparant. You get all the tools you need and acces to all the data. [Go to this page (made by the BI peeps) and go nuts](https://www.notion.so/8f7739b14e754f7194992ce9b34d0d07) (not public).

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

    Something you can do yourself is asking for upward feedback using a typeform/googleform. Send these questions to your team and see where you're at:
    
    - My teamlead regularly gives me actionable feedback that helps me improve my performance.
    - My teamlead does not micromanage (i.e., get involved in details that should be handled at other levels).
    - My teamlead regularly shares relevant info and/or insights from the MT.
    - My teamlead is easy to approach with problems/concerns/feedback.
    - My teamlead communicates clear goals for our team.
    - My teamlead keeps the team focus on our priority results/deliverables/OKR?s.

Content: # People System - Salarisbalie - Requesting Time off & Expensing

Salarisbalie is our payroll specialist and makes sure we get paid correctly every month, Salarisbalie works within a tool called NMBRS. NMBRS is used for saving and monitoring all personnel files,  personal information, holidays, dossiers, contracts, etc. 

When you start at Blendle, you get onboarded in this system. Easy peasy, everything in one place. 

You, HR and your lead have access to this self service tool.

So what can you do with Nmbrs?   Next to accessing your personal information and contracts, you can also change your contact information yourself. Plus, requesting time off and claiming expenses just became a whole lot easier: 

- **Time off request**
    
    **Why are we doing this if we have unlimited holidays?**
    The ""unlimited fair use"" rule stays. We are adding the balance for legal reasons. 
    
    And while we don't have a maximum, we do have a **minimum** that we want you to take, to keep you healthy - 20 days each year, for a 40 hour contract. 
    
    Plus, NMBRS has a super easy way to overview who is out of office and when, Blendle wide.  A great tool for teams and managers to plan work and availability especially around big projects or releases.
    
    **It looks weird in the system.....I see a negative balance!**

Content: # Calling in sick/better

1. You are ill/sick or had an accident and **can not work.**
2. **Let your team and your lead know** that your are sick and when you expect to feel better. If your lead isn't in or on holidays, you can contact HR.
3. **Update everyone** on how you are feeling if it takes longer then expected. Stay home until you are better.
4. **Let everyone know** when you are back.

FYI:

- **Your lead calls you in sick with the [Arbo](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8),** which is important for insurance and legal purposes.
- Arbo helps us (you and Blendle) in case we need advice or help. They have counsols and doctors on speed dial if needed, visit our [Arbo page](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) for the information.
- If you call in sick more then 3 times in a year, that is considered above average, so Arbo advises us to check in with you if you are alright. We will.
- Don't feel guilty for being sick.
- Go to the doctor in time if you need to. Don't act tough.
- If you have weird or vague complaints over a longer period of time like headaches, bad sleep or panic-related stuff. Check your stress level.
- **You want to call or e-mail our direct contact at Arbo directly, you can find the contact details [right here](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8)** (not public)

## What to do when someone calls in sick **?**

People in your team might call in sick at some point. Here's what to do:

- Make sure they **communicate** it well with the team and with you.
- **You call it in at Arbo [by visiting our Arbo portal](https://ja-groep.dossiermanager.nl/)**, which is important for both for Blendle and for the person.
- If people call in sick 3 times in a year, that is a red flag and you should have a conversation about it. HR and Arbo keep track of that and will ping you about this, but we expect you to also **at least notice it** if someone isn't doing really well.
- If it's something more psychological (not the flu or migraine), make sure to flag it and check signs for a burnout. Check when in doubt:

    **Take holidays and days off.**
    
    This one seems obvious, but we know it?s not. We believe that working at Blendle is the Premier League, the creme de la creme :). That takes it?s toll and asks a lot from your body and mind. These two need time to recharge from your efforts. Make sure to build in moments of absolute rest during the year. It?s called a holiday. Make sure to take 4 weeks, and make sure at least 2 of those are in a row. Advice would be to really go away: studies show that this works best. There are some studies showing that taking regular holidays (every quarter) are very effective. So don?t wait 6 months to take 2 weeks. Also take a week every now and then.
    
    **Don?t work when you?re sick**
    
    When you have the flu, stay at home. Get back to work when you are fully recovered. Don?t feel guilty about it (easier said than done, we know). Yes we miss you, but we can do it without you for a few days. Even better: with you being away, your team might have to rethink how certain things are done in your absence. It can cause a new (maybe better) way for tasks and responsibilities to be distributed and single points of failure can be discovered and fixed.

## **Recurring sickness ?**

If people call in sick more than 3 times in a year, that should raise a red flag. If you're leading one or more people, Arbo will also ping you if someone is calling in sick frequently. If sickness absence is recurring, consider if there is a [particular pattern or underlying issues](https://smallbusiness.co.uk/a-stepbystep-guideto-managing-repeated-employee-absence-2461572/) and initiate an open conversation about it.

Do not be afraid of honest discussions, these discussions help to identify return to work barriers and underlying issues. They also help to outline the expectations of all parties involved.

The open discussions encourage your team member to voice her/his concerns and request help. From the team members point of view, these discussions help to effectively manage and monitor sickness absence, particularly in most complex cases such as recurring absences. It also helps to ensure that the sickness management process is structured, consistent, clear and fair.

Content: ## **The conversation**

Try initiating an open conversation by scheduling a meet on the first day of return to work, or at least as soon as you can. The purpose behind this conversation is not to judge someone for being absent. But it's meant to uncover the factors behind, or the cause of the absence. There is a good chance that you or Blendle can prevent the next absence by talking about this.

**Explain why you are having this conversation**

- Don't ask right away about the problems and sickness. Make clear that it's about being absent.
- Share a list of dates and patterns relevant to being absent.
- Talk about how the absence worries you, how it effects the team and anyone close to the team member.

**How to and what questions to ask:**

**Notes**

- Always ask open questions.
- Know your facts, this will prevent unnecessary discussions. You can ask HR for the statics.
- Let your team member steer you towards the right solutions, don't fill in the blanks.
- Take notes, set goals and share them with each other afterwards.
- Monitor the progress, have recurring conversations about the situation and the goals.
- There is a fine barrier between being too pushy and being truly engaged and it's normal to feel that dilemma. Just use your own judgement.

QUESTION: Could you provide me with information regarding the types of severance packages that are offered in instances of termination?
=========
Content: ## **What you can expect from HR**

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.

Content: # General disciplinary measures

Our Social code is crystal clear and very easily to follow. However, we also want to be clear about the consequences if for any reason you fail to follow the rules:

- **Verbal warning.** When we find it necessary to formally give you a warning. It might be a minor violation or your first time.
- **Official written warning**.  You will receive an official written warning for any serious breach of Blendle?s social code. This also applies when you already have had a maximum of two verbal warnings and your behavior hasn't improved. After 1 official written warning, we will move on to more serious measures like suspension or termination.
- **Suspension.** This happens when you have committed a very serious offense, or when we need time to investigate a case. Your access to Blendle will be temporarily revoked until it's clear whether and which measures should be taken.
- **Termination.** When the violation is of a very serious nature. These violations are most of the time determined by law and because of the severity of the act, we can terminate your contract immediately. Or, after an official written warning.

## When do we apply these measures

When we apply a measure, which measure we apply, and how long we apply it always depends on the situation and severity of the violation.

- Any form of harassment including bullying, intimidation, malicious gossip and victimisation of your colleagues, either inside or outside of the office.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: # Firing

Saying goodbye to Blendle (from a colleague) and to a colleague (from Blendle) is a very normal and natural thing. When done right, it can even be a beautiful thing. 

We advise you to read the backdrop below first, but feel free to jump in right away with the 'Here's what you can do'-section :). General note: you do not have to do this alone, so please ask for advice and help!

- **Backdrop**
    
    Saying goodbye to Blendle (from a colleague) and to a colleague (from Blendle) is a very normal and natural thing. When done right, it can even be a beautiful thing.
    
    Saying goodbye to people is also an important part of keeping your team on the right track. Firing can even be a part of your [Personnel Planning](Hiring%20fd6a5e1f88dd4476988147a3a62e1f0d.md). The most common situation will be when you think someone is no longer a good match with Blendle for whatever reason. This doesn't happen overnight, so try to spot situations where this is happening. 
    
    To make things clear: HR and Rick and Alex will help you with this, but we want this to be on your agenda. HR will take care of the process and paper- and legal work. Rick and Alex will help with the tough conversations. **The most important work happens months before that and that's where you come in.**
    
    Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :).

Content: - Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

Content: ## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how. Does this fit in someones personal development path at Blendle? Does it match the personal goals? Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

A good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own. The rest is common sense.

As leads you can decide to say Yes or No to budget requests based on the above questions. If you need help deciding, you can discuss with HR.

**?0-?250** = no study contract. Like a cool book, online course or a ticket to a summit.

**?250-1500 =** 12 months study contract. Like a full blown study/course or a conference (abroad).

**?1500** = edge case with 24 months study contract, please discuss with HR.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: Why me getting salary very low when others are paid so much. I do not wish to work here anymore
=========
Content: - **Off cycle salary increases**
    
    **Contract renewal** is not a moment that automatically means it is time to talk about money. We are not a company of people who demand *""give me X or I walk''*.  
    
    People can bring up salary any moment they want and we take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high) - see ""**How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?""**
    
    **Good reasons to raise offcycle**
    
    - Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.
    - Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone's impact and capabilities. It's important to be able to quantify that curve.
    - New information internally or externally.
    - New information by benchmarking studies or during hiring.
    
    **Not so good reasons to give a raise**
    
    - Colleague got another offer and uses this to get a raise.
    - 'I earn X for this company, that's a lot of money, I want a piece of the pie'.
    - Colleague just wants an incentive to stay. Money is never the answer, because it will fade - very - fast.
- **Control questions**
    
    Now before you finally decide
    
    - If we had to hire someone today for X's job, what would we pay them?
    - What would it cost Blendle as a business to find a new person (hard to replace, scarcity, time to hire, impact on day to day business & product)?
Source: Notion_DB\Blendle's Employee Handbook a834d55573614857a48a9ce9ec4194e3\Salary Review fd385c04dff04c2bb298f7085bf9e78d.md

Content: - **Scarcity & market value.**
        
        It's fair to say that it's harder to fill some positions compared to some other roles. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.
        
    - **Role and responsibilities.**
        
        Certain roles and people make more impact than others. This is reflected in pay.
        
    - **Actual impact and contribution**
        
        Since we don't really like job titles, it's good to look at someone's actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? Can we try to put that in numbers or concrete projects?
        
    - **Someone's starting point**
        
        If we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.
        
    
    *Note: all of this is not an exact science and is determined together, so please: ask for help.*
    
- **When do we talk about money?**
    - **Yearly company wide salary raises in January**
        
        Every year (in January) we take a good look at all the salaries at Cafeyn- Blendle. Right after the feedback cycle (which we use as input) we have salary talks with everyone. We chose to do this once a year so we don't have a constant conversation about money through the year.
        
- **Off cycle salary increases**

Content: # Addressing harassment

You are *always* in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward when you report an incident. We encourage you to talk about what happened.

If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8). In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it?s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. 

Here are the steps you can take, either:

- **Talk to the offender**. If you suspect that an offender doesn?t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.

Content: # Calling in sick/better

1. You are ill/sick or had an accident and **can not work.**
2. **Let your team and your lead know** that your are sick and when you expect to feel better. If your lead isn't in or on holidays, you can contact HR.
3. **Update everyone** on how you are feeling if it takes longer then expected. Stay home until you are better.
4. **Let everyone know** when you are back.

FYI:

- **Your lead calls you in sick with the [Arbo](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8),** which is important for insurance and legal purposes.
- Arbo helps us (you and Blendle) in case we need advice or help. They have counsols and doctors on speed dial if needed, visit our [Arbo page](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) for the information.
- If you call in sick more then 3 times in a year, that is considered above average, so Arbo advises us to check in with you if you are alright. We will.
- Don't feel guilty for being sick.
- Go to the doctor in time if you need to. Don't act tough.
- If you have weird or vague complaints over a longer period of time like headaches, bad sleep or panic-related stuff. Check your stress level.

## **Recurring sickness ?**

If people call in sick more than 3 times in a year, that should raise a red flag. If you're leading one or more people, Arbo will also ping you if someone is calling in sick frequently. If sickness absence is recurring, consider if there is a [particular pattern or underlying issues](https://smallbusiness.co.uk/a-stepbystep-guideto-managing-repeated-employee-absence-2461572/) and initiate an open conversation about it.

Do not be afraid of honest discussions, these discussions help to identify return to work barriers and underlying issues. They also help to outline the expectations of all parties involved.

The open discussions encourage your team member to voice her/his concerns and request help. From the team members point of view, these discussions help to effectively manage and monitor sickness absence, particularly in most complex cases such as recurring absences. It also helps to ensure that the sickness management process is structured, consistent, clear and fair.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behavior is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn?t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions.

If you suspect that someone doesn?t realize their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when:

- Your lead, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.

- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.

Content: # Addressing harassment

You are *always* in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward when you report an incident. We encourage you to talk about what happened.

If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8). In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it?s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. 

Here are the steps you can take, either:

- **Talk to the offender**. If you suspect that an offender doesn?t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.

FINAL ANSWER:","The details of a co-worker's complaint against you will depend on the specific incident and the severity of the harassment. HR and the team lead will act immediately upon receiving a complaint and will inform you about the disciplinary procedures and your options. They will ask you to provide as many details and as much information as possible to aid in the investigation. The disciplinary process will be launched based on the severity of the harassment, and in cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favors under threats, the harasser will be terminated immediately. Employees found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee will also be terminated, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation. If you suspect harassment or are being sexually harassed, you are encouraged to report it to HR, your lead, or the outside confidential counselor. In serious cases like sexual assault, you should also call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. You have the option to talk to the offender directly or to your team lead, who will assess the situation and may involve HR if necessary. It is important to provide as much detail and evidence as possible during these discussions. The specific details of the co-worker's complaint against you cannot be determined without more information.

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life.

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.

QUESTION: What is the reason for the recent restructuring or downsizing?
=========
Content: # Intro: two things you should know

When working at Blendle, there are a few things you should know. Not to scare you. It is just something to be aware of.

## **1. Blendle is a startup**

Blendle is a startup. Your salary (and all benefits) is paid from money from investors. You (and the people you work with) are part of the solution to the problem we are trying to solve. Time lost or wasted is bad, because it doesn?t bring us closer to the goal: supporting quality journalism. We need money to do so. Finding the right product-market fit (building a freaking beautiful product which the whole world wants to use) and becoming profitable is crucial to reaching the end goal.

We tend to say to people (imagine a smile on our face): ?Hey, but no pressure!?, and then we both start to laugh (or else it is awkward). Well let me say this once, loud and clear: we realise that there is pressure. It can be pretty intense. This is not a regular corporate day job, and that has its up- and downsides. Example upside: we don?t care where and when you work, which means flexibility. Example downside: you have to be able to regulate yourself, which can be hard.

There are a lot of product/business choices made because of this survival mode. Some you might like (a lot of freedom and responsibility in your work), some you might dislike (pressure on shipping, for example). **Bottom line: survival mode results in a fast-paced, high-pressure, sometimes hectic/chaotic environment.**

Content: # What can Blendle do?

There?s a lot Blendle could improve and we?re working on that. The fact that we are a fast-paced startup with an aim to save journalism is not something that will change any time soon. This also means that we are facing a runway, which affects our everyday work. This is fuelling us to go the extra mile, but the downsides are also obvious.

So what can Blendle do?

- **Voicing vision & mission more:** everybody should feel connected to where Blendle is going and why. Talking about this more will help everybody align. This way everybody has more influence on the direction and it is more clear why a change of direction is made and how this affects your work.
- Open channels: **work on transparency and trust**: everybody should be able to speak up if they feel that the stress level is too high. Also when someone feels like they aren?t in the right role or simply doing work they don?t love everyday.
- **Build an environment which is less stressful.** This piece is step 1 on this point. Notice when people work too much. Tell people if we notice it and tell them to take action (go home, take holiday, work less, talk to someone). Let?s also keep improving the process we have in place for when people feel it?s too much.

Content: We know this adds to your tally. Again, just becoming aware of this already helps.

And also again, when you see something causing a lot of stress, let?s get to work on it. Not digging the new team structure? Not feeling your current role? Not happy with your team lead? Bring it up with someone you trust (HR, your team lead, Alexander, just anyone) and let?s try to fix it or at least talk about it.

Blendle cares. We care. So if you?re struggling, let?s change things to make sure you are happy, healthy and at your best.

# 3. Make changes: here are some quick wins

- **Look at your work life balance**
    
    
    > In engineering, people talk about asset integrity, which means that you service the machinery before it breaks. In modern organizations, the work is thinking and the machinery is your brain. We know from cognitive science that there are hard limits to what the brain can deal with. And yet, there?s an awful lot in the way we work which flies in the face of that. We think that if we work through the night, we?re being very clever. We?re not. We think we can work long hours ? month after month, year after year ? and that there won?t be any wear and tear. But there is.

Content: - **Off cycle salary increases**
    
    **Contract renewal** is not a moment that automatically means it is time to talk about money. We are not a company of people who demand *""give me X or I walk''*.  
    
    People can bring up salary any moment they want and we take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high) - see ""**How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?""**
    
    **Good reasons to raise offcycle**
    
    - Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.
    - Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone's impact and capabilities. It's important to be able to quantify that curve.
    - New information internally or externally.
    - New information by benchmarking studies or during hiring.
    
    **Not so good reasons to give a raise**
    
    - Colleague got another offer and uses this to get a raise.
    - 'I earn X for this company, that's a lot of money, I want a piece of the pie'.
    - Colleague just wants an incentive to stay. Money is never the answer, because it will fade - very - fast.
- **Control questions**
    
    Now before you finally decide
    
    - If we had to hire someone today for X's job, what would we pay them?
    - What would it cost Blendle as a business to find a new person (hard to replace, scarcity, time to hire, impact on day to day business & product)?

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Content: - Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

Content: - **Sexual harassment is never too minor to be dealt with.** Any kind of harassment can wear you down and create a hostile workplace. We will hear every claim and take appropriate disciplinary actions.
- **Sexual harassment is about how we make others feel.** Many do not consider behaviors like flirting or sexual comments to be sexual harassment, thinking they are too innocent to be labeled that way. But, if something you do makes your colleagues uncomfortable, or makes them feel unsafe, you must stop. Whether it is on or off Blendle premises.
- **We assume every sexual harassment claim is legitimate unless proven otherwise.** We listen to victims of sexual harassment and always conduct our investigations properly. Occasional false reports do not undermine this principle.
- **We will not allow further victimization of harassed employees.** We will fully support employees who were sexually harassed and will not take any adverse action against them. For example, we will not move them to positions with worse pay or benefits or allow others to retaliate against them.
- **Those who support or overlook sexual harassment are as much at fault as offenders.** Leads and HR especially are obliged to prevent sexual harassment and act when they have suspicions or receive reports. Letting this behavior go on or encouraging it will bring about disciplinary action. Anyone who witnesses an incident of sexual harassment or has other kinds of proof should report to HR.

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.

Officer Rivera was 22.

Content: # Addressing harassment

You are *always* in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward when you report an incident. We encourage you to talk about what happened.

If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8). In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it?s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. 

Here are the steps you can take, either:

- **Talk to the offender**. If you suspect that an offender doesn?t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.

Content: ## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how. Does this fit in someones personal development path at Blendle? Does it match the personal goals? Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

A good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own. The rest is common sense.

As leads you can decide to say Yes or No to budget requests based on the above questions. If you need help deciding, you can discuss with HR.

**?0-?250** = no study contract. Like a cool book, online course or a ticket to a summit.

**?250-1500 =** 12 months study contract. Like a full blown study/course or a conference (abroad).

**?1500** = edge case with 24 months study contract, please discuss with HR.

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

**Recruitment**

This might be one of the most important questions: Who would you like to work with? You might have noticed: we?re expanding! While trying to conquer the world, we need to gather our own army of super-duper extraterrestrial-powered heroes (you know them as your colleagues). We still have a lot of vacancies open? but apart from them, we?re always looking for new recruits. So, do you know anyone fitting the (or a) profile? Let them know we?re looking for ?em or let HR know they need to contact them.

**Business intelligence**

Sounds cool. It is. We want everybody to be informed and make the best decisions possible because all the intel is available. This is also a great way to be transparant. You get all the tools you need and acces to all the data. [Go to this page (made by the BI peeps) and go nuts](https://www.notion.so/8f7739b14e754f7194992ce9b34d0d07) (not public).

Content: - Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

    > In engineering, people talk about asset integrity, which means that you service the machinery before it breaks. In modern organizations, the work is thinking and the machinery is your brain. We know from cognitive science that there are hard limits to what the brain can deal with. And yet, there?s an awful lot in the way we work which flies in the face of that. We think that if we work through the night, we?re being very clever. We?re not. We think we can work long hours ? month after month, year after year ? and that there won?t be any wear and tear. But there is.

    'Duhhhh'.
    
    I still see people not taking notes and it's frustrating because your wasting everyone's time. Without notes, all you have to go on is your - pretty biased - memory and gut feeling. You prepared your interview, so write down the answers you get on the questions you thought were crucial to ask. You can use this in during the decisions and actually give examples: 'When I asked X, she answered Y and that testifies that she really understands the concept and did her homework'. 
    
- **Use Ratings**
    
    Ratings quantify the unquantifiable. Force yourself to chose and try to come up with an explanation for that rating. We rate from 1-3 and rate on Work, Drive and fit. 
    Use the profile you made, your notes, the matrix and your overall findings to explain your ratings if need be.

    Everyone is biased. 
    
    Your bias doesn't help you make good decisions and evaluate a person.

- **Ask good questions** (and listen).
    
    Asking good questions can be hard, so think about this when preparing your interview. This mainly applies to the section where you check work, drive and fit (also the three things you will be rating when making a decision).
    
    We recommend you come up with your own set and testing them out. What questions 'work' and which one don't? Share this with your hiring team! It's not per se a bad idea to ask the same kind of question to a person several times by several people. 
    
    Use the art of listening and follow up questions. Short questions like: can you elaborate on that? Why? Can you give an example? What effect did that have? How would you approach that situation now? What other options did you have? What happened? How? Can you explain?
    
    **Types of questions.** 
    
    There are different types of questions. Experiment with different types of questioning.

    Are you doing the right job? Do you get energy from what you are doing? Do you feel like you?re making a difference? Do you love most of it? Of course there will be stuff you don?t like, that?s totally normal. But are you doing things you are good at and you like? And is there enough challenge, perspective and room to grow?
    
    Are you getting enough praise and feedback? Do you know what is expected from you? Do you know how you are doing at the moment?
    
    It?s really important that you know how your team and team leads think you are doing. Ask them! What are you doing well, what needs to improve. Use the structure we came up with: 1on1?s, personal goals, feedback sessions, peer reviews. But feel free to alter them in order for them to work for you. Just don?t do nothing.
    
- **Last but not least: get informed.**
    
    There is a lot of information out there. Inform yourself. It will help you recognize a potential threat earlier and help you act on that.

Content: Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behavior is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn?t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions.

If you suspect that someone doesn?t realize their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when:

- Your lead, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.

Content: ## **What you can expect from HR**

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: Could you kindly elucidate the monetary remuneration spectrum applicable to the vocation I currently occupy within this esteemed organization?
=========
Content: - **Off cycle salary increases**
    
    **Contract renewal** is not a moment that automatically means it is time to talk about money. We are not a company of people who demand *""give me X or I walk''*.  
    
    People can bring up salary any moment they want and we take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high) - see ""**How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?""**
    
    **Good reasons to raise offcycle**
    
    - Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.
    - Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone's impact and capabilities. It's important to be able to quantify that curve.
    - New information internally or externally.
    - New information by benchmarking studies or during hiring.
    
    **Not so good reasons to give a raise**
    
    - Colleague got another offer and uses this to get a raise.
    - 'I earn X for this company, that's a lot of money, I want a piece of the pie'.
    - Colleague just wants an incentive to stay. Money is never the answer, because it will fade - very - fast.
- **Control questions**
    
    Now before you finally decide
    
    - If we had to hire someone today for X's job, what would we pay them?
    - What would it cost Blendle as a business to find a new person (hard to replace, scarcity, time to hire, impact on day to day business & product)?

Content: - **Scarcity & market value.**
        
        It's fair to say that it's harder to fill some positions compared to some other roles. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.
        
    - **Role and responsibilities.**
        
        Certain roles and people make more impact than others. This is reflected in pay.
        
    - **Actual impact and contribution**
        
        Since we don't really like job titles, it's good to look at someone's actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? Can we try to put that in numbers or concrete projects?
        
    - **Someone's starting point**
        
        If we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.
        
    
    *Note: all of this is not an exact science and is determined together, so please: ask for help.*
    
- **When do we talk about money?**
    - **Yearly company wide salary raises in January**
        
        Every year (in January) we take a good look at all the salaries at Cafeyn- Blendle. Right after the feedback cycle (which we use as input) we have salary talks with everyone. We chose to do this once a year so we don't have a constant conversation about money through the year.

Content: # Salary Review

- **How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?**
    
    We weigh up several variables:
    
    - **Benchmark:** internal and external.
        
        The most accurate way to determine the range where someone should be is comparing someone with a peer internally. During the hiring process you find out at what level someone is and you'll be able to compare him or her internally. Who would you compare this person to in terms of level? Is he/she better than X? If you notice that everyone is not as good as the people we have, but are paid more: think about raising the salary of our people. Keep in mind that - especially in tech - the market is on tilt. Big corporate pay a lot of money to even mediocare people in tech. We don't want to compete with them and that is a choice for new hires to make. 
        
    - **Classic figures:** experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise.
        
        This is a bit old school in a way, but also at Blendle there is a difference between someone who is a starter with no experience or someone with 8 years of experience. For some jobs/roles we need certain skills, expertise or even education. This always comes with a price tag. 
        
    - **Scarcity & market value.**

There is money and time you can spend on celebrating stuff and for learning and development. We want you, as a Team Lead, to feel free to spend this money and time within these boundaries so you don't need permission every time you spend it on these two topics. We want to create clarity so you have the liberty?o spend money on this. We don't want to limit your thinking by coming up with a budget, so feel free to ask HR if you'd like to bend the budgets for a good reason.

Apart from the Blendle-wide parties, outings and celebrations, we came up with a number for you to spend on team related stuff. **Every person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on fun stuff.** Why not ?80 or ?20?

FINAL ANSWER:","The monetary remuneration spectrum applicable to the vocation within the organization is determined based on several factors, including benchmarking, experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise, scarcity and market value, role and responsibilities, and actual impact and contribution. Salary reviews are conducted annually in January, and off-cycle salary increases may be considered for reasons such as drastic changes in role and responsibilities, steep learning curves, new information internally or externally, or benchmarking studies. It is important to note that salary discussions can be initiated by employees at any time if they feel their pay is too low or too high. The organization does not encourage using other job offers as leverage for a raise, and emphasizes that money should not be the sole incentive for employees to stay. The organization also provides a party budget of ?60 per person per year for team-related activities and a study budget that can be flexibly allocated based on reasonable requests.

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how. Does this fit in someones personal development path at Blendle? Does it match the personal goals? Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

A good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own. The rest is common sense.

As leads you can decide to say Yes or No to budget requests based on the above questions. If you need help deciding, you can discuss with HR.

**?0-?250** = no study contract. Like a cool book, online course or a ticket to a summit.

**?250-1500 =** 12 months study contract. Like a full blown study/course or a conference (abroad).

**?1500** = edge case with 24 months study contract, please discuss with HR.

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution.

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.

Content: Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behavior is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn?t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions.

If you suspect that someone doesn?t realize their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when:

- Your lead, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.

Content: # Addressing harassment

You are *always* in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward when you report an incident. We encourage you to talk about what happened.

If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8). In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it?s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. 

Here are the steps you can take, either:

- **Talk to the offender**. If you suspect that an offender doesn?t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.

Content: - **Off cycle salary increases**
    
    **Contract renewal** is not a moment that automatically means it is time to talk about money. We are not a company of people who demand *""give me X or I walk''*.  
    
    People can bring up salary any moment they want and we take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high) - see ""**How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?""**
    
    **Good reasons to raise offcycle**
    
    - Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.
    - Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone's impact and capabilities. It's important to be able to quantify that curve.
    - New information internally or externally.
    - New information by benchmarking studies or during hiring.
    
    **Not so good reasons to give a raise**
    
    - Colleague got another offer and uses this to get a raise.
    - 'I earn X for this company, that's a lot of money, I want a piece of the pie'.
    - Colleague just wants an incentive to stay. Money is never the answer, because it will fade - very - fast.
- **Control questions**
    
    Now before you finally decide
    
    - If we had to hire someone today for X's job, what would we pay them?

Content: # Party and study budget

There is money and time you can spend on celebrating stuff and for learning and development. We want you, as a Team Lead, to feel free to spend this money and time within these boundaries so you don't need permission every time you spend it on these two topics. We want to create clarity so you have the liberty?o spend money on this. We don't want to limit your thinking by coming up with a budget, so feel free to ask HR if you'd like to bend the budgets for a good reason.

You are in the lead for these two topics for your team. 

## Party budget

Apart from the Blendle-wide parties, outings and celebrations, we came up with a number for you to spend on team related stuff. **Every person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on fun stuff.** Why not ?80 or ?20? No good reason, we figured you could go out for dinner twice with your team for ?60. Every person keeps track of this for themselves.  

## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in.""

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

Content: Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behavior is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn?t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions.

If you suspect that someone doesn?t realize their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when:

- Your lead, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.

Content: ## **What you can expect from HR**

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.

If you suspect that someone doesn?t realize their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when:

- Your lead, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more.

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.

QUESTION: Could you please provide me with an accurate estimation of the remaining quantum of vacation days at my disposal?
=========
Content: **It looks weird in the system.....I see a negative balance!**
    
    For everyone with a 40 hours contract, the **minimum balance is set as 20 days** in NMBRS each year, and this re-sets at the start of each year.  In the case that you didn't take all 20 days by end of December (we hope this is not the case as you should take the advised minimum, at a minimum), these days will show in your balance for the next year for 6 months.
    
    (note: as we are introducing the tool in June 2020, the remaining balance is 10 for 2020, that's half of the normal balance)
    
    On the other hand, if **you exceed this minimum balance** you will show as negative in the system.  Nothing to worry about **-** remember... **we don't track your holidays in that kind of way**.  As long as your manager has agreed to your holidays and you have added your request, it's fine to go negative. 
    
    **How do I submit my holiday plans?**
    After discussing your time off with your lead and team, go to NMBRS to submit the request. To do so, log in to your [https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/](https://salarisbalie.nmbrs.nl/) account and choose ""Verlof"". Fill in the dates, reason, save it and done!. Your lead will get a signal to approve the request through NMBRS.

Content: 'Time off' can be divided into two buckets:
    
    1. **Holidays and national holidays**:
        
        Your contract states you have 4 weeks of paid time off per year, by law.
        
        On average we have 8 national holidays per year. We have no CAO (collective employment agreement), which means you are not entitled to paid time off on every national holiday. We decided to follow the most common situation in an average company, which in practice means most people are off on the big national holidays. But that's your own choice, it's not a right or an obligation, so feel free to improvise. Some teams even have to (editorial and support, for example).
        
        These rules state that we are off on 'Bevrijdingsdag' once every 5 years. But we aren't allowed time off on Eid al-Fitr (Suikerfeest, ending of the Ramadan). That makes no sense to us. 
        
        So here is how we approach holidays and national holidays in practice.
        
        You 'have' 5 weeks holiday and ~8 national holidays per year. We want you to use this time off to reload but you decide when and how to consume this. You must also feel free to improvise. You work hard, maybe even a bit too hard, so you might need some extra time off to stay happy and healthy. This also works the other way around: maybe you had a chill quarter and feel no need to take a holiday: feel free to do so. We want you to think about what your body and mind needs instead of your quota.

Content: - When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.
- When people work hard, **poke them** to take time off so they recharge.
- For longer leaves of absence (~4 weeks) ping HR for advice.

    > In engineering, people talk about asset integrity, which means that you service the machinery before it breaks. In modern organizations, the work is thinking and the machinery is your brain. We know from cognitive science that there are hard limits to what the brain can deal with. And yet, there?s an awful lot in the way we work which flies in the face of that. We think that if we work through the night, we?re being very clever. We?re not. We think we can work long hours ? month after month, year after year ? and that there won?t be any wear and tear. But there is.

## **Recurring sickness ?**

If people call in sick more than 3 times in a year, that should raise a red flag. If you're leading one or more people, Arbo will also ping you if someone is calling in sick frequently. If sickness absence is recurring, consider if there is a [particular pattern or underlying issues](https://smallbusiness.co.uk/a-stepbystep-guideto-managing-repeated-employee-absence-2461572/) and initiate an open conversation about it.

Do not be afraid of honest discussions, these discussions help to identify return to work barriers and underlying issues. They also help to outline the expectations of all parties involved.

The open discussions encourage your team member to voice her/his concerns and request help. From the team members point of view, these discussions help to effectively manage and monitor sickness absence, particularly in most complex cases such as recurring absences. It also helps to ensure that the sickness management process is structured, consistent, clear and fair.

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward.

- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.

If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8). In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it?s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. 

Here are the steps you can take, either:

- **Talk to the offender**. If you suspect that an offender doesn?t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).
- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.

Content: # General disciplinary measures

Our Social code is crystal clear and very easily to follow. However, we also want to be clear about the consequences if for any reason you fail to follow the rules:

- **Verbal warning.** When we find it necessary to formally give you a warning. It might be a minor violation or your first time.
- **Official written warning**.  You will receive an official written warning for any serious breach of Blendle?s social code. This also applies when you already have had a maximum of two verbal warnings and your behavior hasn't improved. After 1 official written warning, we will move on to more serious measures like suspension or termination.
- **Suspension.** This happens when you have committed a very serious offense, or when we need time to investigate a case. Your access to Blendle will be temporarily revoked until it's clear whether and which measures should be taken.
- **Termination.** When the violation is of a very serious nature. These violations are most of the time determined by law and because of the severity of the act, we can terminate your contract immediately. Or, after an official written warning.

## When do we apply these measures

When we apply a measure, which measure we apply, and how long we apply it always depends on the situation and severity of the violation.

- Any form of harassment including bullying, intimidation, malicious gossip and victimisation of your colleagues, either inside or outside of the office.

- **Take notes**
    
    'Duhhhh'.
    
    I still see people not taking notes and it's frustrating because your wasting everyone's time. Without notes, all you have to go on is your - pretty biased - memory and gut feeling. You prepared your interview, so write down the answers you get on the questions you thought were crucial to ask. You can use this in during the decisions and actually give examples: 'When I asked X, she answered Y and that testifies that she really understands the concept and did her homework'. 
    
- **Use Ratings**
    
    Ratings quantify the unquantifiable. Force yourself to chose and try to come up with an explanation for that rating. We rate from 1-3 and rate on Work, Drive and fit.

FINAL ANSWER:","If you encounter a situation necessitating a formal grievance against a colleague, you should report it to HR, your team lead, or an outside confidential counselor. You have the option to talk to the offender directly or talk to your team lead about the situation. HR and the team lead will act immediately and inform you about the disciplinary procedures and your options. The disciplinary process will depend on the severity of the harassment, and in cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favors under threats, the harasser will be terminated immediately. If an employee is found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, they will be terminated even if HR has not conducted its own investigation. The consequences for failing to follow the rules, including harassment, can range from verbal warnings to termination. The specific measure applied and its duration will depend on the situation and severity of the violation.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.

Content: - **Off cycle salary increases**
    
    **Contract renewal** is not a moment that automatically means it is time to talk about money. We are not a company of people who demand *""give me X or I walk''*.  
    
    People can bring up salary any moment they want and we take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high) - see ""**How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?""**
    
    **Good reasons to raise offcycle**
    
    - Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.
    - Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone's impact and capabilities. It's important to be able to quantify that curve.
    - New information internally or externally.
    - New information by benchmarking studies or during hiring.
    
    **Not so good reasons to give a raise**
    
    - Colleague got another offer and uses this to get a raise.
    - 'I earn X for this company, that's a lot of money, I want a piece of the pie'.
    - Colleague just wants an incentive to stay. Money is never the answer, because it will fade - very - fast.
- **Control questions**
    
    Now before you finally decide
    
    - If we had to hire someone today for X's job, what would we pay them?
    - What would it cost Blendle as a business to find a new person (hard to replace, scarcity, time to hire, impact on day to day business & product)?

Content: # Salary Review

- **How do we determine someone's salary in the first place?**
    
    We weigh up several variables:
    
    - **Benchmark:** internal and external.
        
        The most accurate way to determine the range where someone should be is comparing someone with a peer internally. During the hiring process you find out at what level someone is and you'll be able to compare him or her internally. Who would you compare this person to in terms of level? Is he/she better than X? If you notice that everyone is not as good as the people we have, but are paid more: think about raising the salary of our people. Keep in mind that - especially in tech - the market is on tilt. Big corporate pay a lot of money to even mediocare people in tech. We don't want to compete with them and that is a choice for new hires to make. 
        
    - **Classic figures:** experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise.
        
        This is a bit old school in a way, but also at Blendle there is a difference between someone who is a starter with no experience or someone with 8 years of experience. For some jobs/roles we need certain skills, expertise or even education. This always comes with a price tag. 
        
    - **Scarcity & market value.**

There is money and time you can spend on celebrating stuff and for learning and development. We want you, as a Team Lead, to feel free to spend this money and time within these boundaries so you don't need permission every time you spend it on these two topics. We want to create clarity so you have the liberty?o spend money on this. We don't want to limit your thinking by coming up with a budget, so feel free to ask HR if you'd like to bend the budgets for a good reason.

You are in the lead for these two topics for your team. 

## Party budget

Apart from the Blendle-wide parties, outings and celebrations, we came up with a number for you to spend on team related stuff. **Every person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on fun stuff.** Why not ?80 or ?20? No good reason, we figured you could go out for dinner twice with your team for ?60. Every person keeps track of this for themselves.  

## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in.""

When there is a complaint, HR and team lead will act immediately. You will stay in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward. 

We will:

- Inform you about our disciplinary procedures and your options.
- Ask you to give us as many details and as much information as possible. It will help us investigate the matter to the best of our ability.
- Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment. In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to give sexual favours under threats, we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate employees who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee, even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.

Content: Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behavior is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn?t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions.

If you suspect that someone doesn?t realize their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when:

- Your lead, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
- Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.

In the above cases, report to HR or our outside [confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8) as soon as possible.

## Disciplinary measures

- Employees who are found guilty of sexual assault by a court of law will be terminated after the first complaint and investigation.
- Employees who are found guilty by Blendle of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time will be suspended for at least 2 weeks without pay.

We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.

We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. Employees of any sexual orientation or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.

Content: # Firing

Saying goodbye to Blendle (from a colleague) and to a colleague (from Blendle) is a very normal and natural thing. When done right, it can even be a beautiful thing. 

We advise you to read the backdrop below first, but feel free to jump in right away with the 'Here's what you can do'-section :). General note: you do not have to do this alone, so please ask for advice and help!

- **Backdrop**
    
    Saying goodbye to Blendle (from a colleague) and to a colleague (from Blendle) is a very normal and natural thing. When done right, it can even be a beautiful thing.
    
    Saying goodbye to people is also an important part of keeping your team on the right track. Firing can even be a part of your [Personnel Planning](Hiring%20fd6a5e1f88dd4476988147a3a62e1f0d.md). The most common situation will be when you think someone is no longer a good match with Blendle for whatever reason. This doesn't happen overnight, so try to spot situations where this is happening. 
    
    To make things clear: HR and Rick and Alex will help you with this, but we want this to be on your agenda. HR will take care of the process and paper- and legal work. Rick and Alex will help with the tough conversations. **The most important work happens months before that and that's where you come in.**
    
    Why? You actually work with your people and see how they are really doing. You have 1on1's, off-sites, projects and feedback sessions together. All the information flows to you as a lead :).

Content: - Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Entrance code: [here](https://www.notion.so/8354943cbce846e086ad48e67dc153bc)

You can park your car [here](http://www.parkeren-utrecht.nl/parkeergarage-moreelsepark). Our Office Manager will get you a parking card asap (if you plan to come by car often). Until then, you can get a get-out-of-parking-stamp with her. Blendle will pay for it.

Or just come by train, we?ll get you a fancy NS business card.

When you enter on your first day, it?s probably best to team up with your teammate/buddy and sit next to or near him or her. Just know that you?re free to sit anywhere you like. Just know that further to the back (behind the meeting rooms) we like to keep things quiet. Just to keep focus :). To improve focus we have one rule called the headphone-rule. Headphones on means ""do not disturb"". Pretty straight-forward, but it works.

More practical information about our office and door lock can be found [**here](General%20&%20practical%20b2682126db8e47bf8e5fabb8b5b4c1ce.md)**

Alexander and Marten stay in touch and, after seeing the first sketches, Alexander sees the potential and decides to join. Together they have an 'office' in the staircase of the science centre Nemo in Amsterdam.

Alexander and Marten take all the feedback and criticism from the publishers back to their 'office' and keep improving the product.

**Snacks and more**

There will be beer, soda and snacks after All-hands presentations. 

On any other regular day:

- We might have chips etc, but op = op. We order snacks sometimes.
- This also goes for the cookies, fizzy drinks, beer or club mate.
- Fruit is something we want to provide everyday. If you notice we run out of fruit too fast and too often, ping our Office Manager so she can fix this.

If you are a big snack lover or don't want to be left empty-handed, consider bringing your own snacks.

**Clean up your shit**

You need to clean up your own shit. Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don't forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine. This 'system' works really well and keeps us away from bullshit like dishwasher duty.

Fahima is here every day, twice a day to clean this place, including toilets.

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?le is in charge of lunch ??sk her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.

Officer Rivera was 22.

**Snacks and more**

There will be beer, soda and snacks after All-hands presentations. 

On any other regular day:

- We might have chips etc, but op = op. We order snacks sometimes.
- This also goes for the cookies, fizzy drinks, beer or club mate.
- Fruit is something we want to provide everyday. If you notice we run out of fruit too fast and too often, ping our Office Manager so she can fix this.

If you are a big snack lover or don't want to be left empty-handed, consider bringing your own snacks.

---

**Clean up your shit**

You need to clean up your own shit. Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don't forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine. This 'system' works really well and keeps us away from bullshit like dishwasher duty.

Fahima is here every day, twice a day to clean this place, including toilets.

**Think about the environment.**

Kill the lights. Turn down the heating. Don't waste paper #deadtrees. We separate our garbage into paper, glass, plastics and rest. Don't waste food: feel free to take home bread on Friday.

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?le is in charge of lunch ??sk her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

You can park your car [here](http://www.parkeren-utrecht.nl/parkeergarage-moreelsepark). Our Office Manager will get you a parking card asap (if you plan to come by car often). Until then, you can get a get-out-of-parking-stamp with her. Blendle will pay for it.

Or just come by train, we?ll get you a fancy NS business card.

When you enter on your first day, it?s probably best to team up with your teammate/buddy and sit next to or near him or her. Just know that you?re free to sit anywhere you like. Just know that further to the back (behind the meeting rooms) we like to keep things quiet. Just to keep focus :). To improve focus we have one rule called the headphone-rule. Headphones on means ""do not disturb"". Pretty straight-forward, but it works.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: - Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Content: # Culture & Role-Modelling

This might be a given but we think it is so important that we dedicated a section to it: the soft shit. Everything that is not concrete or directly work-related, but is as important.  

- **Vision, mission and strategy**
    
    For people at Blendle, it's really important to know why they are doing what they do and what the effect or impact is. You probably constantly think and talk about why and how we do things. Don't forget that your team members often don't have that context. Here are two things to close that gap of information and context.
    
    - **Proactively share what was discussed in high-level meetings.** Also what did we decide not to do and how was the decision made (based on hypotheses or data?).
    - **Ask your team** if they know **why they are doing** what they're doing. Remind them of it if you feel the need.
- **Vibe and morale**
    
    Working in a nice and vibrant environment is important to all of us. A place where people are motivated, willing and positive. Do not underestimate the importance of this and the impact it can have on the daily work. Two things you can do:
    
    - Make it a recurring agenda point during retrospectives: how was the vibe during this sprint?
    - Address it if you feel morale is fading. It can be a red flag. Is it one person? One situation? One team? One project? Or is it more?
    
- **Culture**

QUESTION: What's the best way to lose weight?
=========
Content: **Food and exercise**
    
    Crucial to feeling well, is taking care of your body. Studies show that exercise is crucial when having a demanding job. That doesn?t mean we want you all to be fitgirls and fitboys. But: get moving. Go skating, hiking, biking, surfing, do yoga. Do something. Your body isn?t made to sit in a chair all day. Use the facilities at the office (standing desks and desk bikes) and try to go for a walk every day (is the 1on1-walk a thing yet?). The things you consume also affect this of course, no secrets there. Take care of yourself by consuming good stuff. No rocket science: just more veggies and water, less alcohol and smoking. Take care of yourself.
    
    **When something is wrong: go see a doctor:**
    
    Don?t wait too long to go see a doctor or therapist. It?s very normal to talk to a psychologist or coach every once in awhile. Just as normal as visiting a physiotherapist for back pain because you have an office job.
    
- **Setting priorities right and saying no (I know this is hard)**
    
    
    1. You, your family, friends and loved ones
    2. Blendle
    
    It?s important to know what the right order is. Your health comes first. Your loved ones come first. We want you to pay attention to your number 1 priority and have your private life in order. Because if it?s not, it will add to your stress level.

Content: - **Take care of your body and mind**
    
    
    **Take holidays and days off.**
    
    This one seems obvious, but we know it?s not. We believe that working at Blendle is the Premier League, the creme de la creme :). That takes it?s toll and asks a lot from your body and mind. These two need time to recharge from your efforts. Make sure to build in moments of absolute rest during the year. It?s called a holiday. Make sure to take 4 weeks, and make sure at least 2 of those are in a row. Advice would be to really go away: studies show that this works best. There are some studies showing that taking regular holidays (every quarter) are very effective. So don?t wait 6 months to take 2 weeks. Also take a week every now and then.
    
    **Don?t work when you?re sick**
    
    When you have the flu, stay at home. Get back to work when you are fully recovered. Don?t feel guilty about it (easier said than done, we know). Yes we miss you, but we can do it without you for a few days. Even better: with you being away, your team might have to rethink how certain things are done in your absence. It can cause a new (maybe better) way for tasks and responsibilities to be distributed and single points of failure can be discovered and fixed.

Content: When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:
    
    - **It is impossible to work 60 hours productively over a longer period of time.** It hurts you and Blendle to work that much. If you are able to work 8 productive hours a day you should be proud of that. Sometimes it will be 6, sometimes 10: relax, it?s okay, You?re not working in a factory with time stamps.
    - Be flexible. Some days you just don?t have it. **You are not a machine.** Of course, first you?ll take a walk and grab a double espresso or a Club Mate, but if that doesn?t work it?s okay. Go home. Go to the gym. Go play with your kid. Go kiting. Go for a walk in the forest. Anything, just don?t sit behind your desk to ?make the hours?. That?s not helping anybody.
    - Working at home vs. at Blendle HQ. Try to strike a **balance between home/office**. Meetings and brainstorms are best done face to face but a day of deep work is best done in a cafe or on an abandoned island with 4g.
    - **Rotate, change your pace.** During the summer it can be nice to start at 6:30 and bike to the beach at 15.00h. During the winter, every morning might feel like a small hangover and you stroll into HQ at 10:00 after your first 2 cups of coffee.
- **Take care of your body and mind**
    
    
    **Take holidays and days off.**

Content: We know this adds to your tally. Again, just becoming aware of this already helps.

And also again, when you see something causing a lot of stress, let?s get to work on it. Not digging the new team structure? Not feeling your current role? Not happy with your team lead? Bring it up with someone you trust (HR, your team lead, Alexander, just anyone) and let?s try to fix it or at least talk about it.

Blendle cares. We care. So if you?re struggling, let?s change things to make sure you are happy, healthy and at your best.

# 3. Make changes: here are some quick wins

- **Look at your work life balance**
    
    
    > In engineering, people talk about asset integrity, which means that you service the machinery before it breaks. In modern organizations, the work is thinking and the machinery is your brain. We know from cognitive science that there are hard limits to what the brain can deal with. And yet, there?s an awful lot in the way we work which flies in the face of that. We think that if we work through the night, we?re being very clever. We?re not. We think we can work long hours ? month after month, year after year ? and that there won?t be any wear and tear. But there is.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

**Good news:** you can do something.

# 1. Check yourself:

When looking at all the things stated in chapter 3, you might recognize some stuff. In addition you can fill in this self test: 

[Burnout Self-Test: Are You at Risk?](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTCS_08.htm)

So how are you?

[]()

- I'm good!
    
    Great, take some time to realize why you are doing fine and take measures in order to prevent yourself from getting to stressed.
    
- I?m okay-ish, but something needs to change.
    - Start by telling your team lead that you feel like you have been on your toes for a while and you think you need time to recover. Also tell your team. Also tell HR.
    - Come up with a concrete 2 week plan (we can help you with that) to release some of the first pressure. This will mean a less busy sprint, shorter days, and maybe 2 weeks of 4 days to start with (or a holiday). The hours you gain, you can spend on things you enjoy and help you reload (Netflix, sports, cinema, go to the beach, visit friends, play with model trains). We learned that just doing nothing, doesn?t always help, so make sure to spend time on things you like.
    - During these two weeks you check in with your team lead how your stress level is. You can make it really concrete by giving your stress level a number (1-10).

Content: - Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

**Snacks and more**

There will be beer, soda and snacks after All-hands presentations. 

On any other regular day:

- We might have chips etc, but op = op. We order snacks sometimes.
- This also goes for the cookies, fizzy drinks, beer or club mate.
- Fruit is something we want to provide everyday. If you notice we run out of fruit too fast and too often, ping our Office Manager so she can fix this.

If you are a big snack lover or don't want to be left empty-handed, consider bringing your own snacks.

**Clean up your shit**

You need to clean up your own shit. Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don't forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine. This 'system' works really well and keeps us away from bullshit like dishwasher duty.

Fahima is here every day, twice a day to clean this place, including toilets.

**Think about the environment.**

Kill the lights. Turn down the heating. Don't waste paper #deadtrees. We separate our garbage into paper, glass, plastics and rest. Don't waste food: feel free to take home bread on Friday.

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

QUESTION: Tell me about your favorite vacation destination.
=========
Content: - **Take care of your body and mind**
    
    
    **Take holidays and days off.**
    
    This one seems obvious, but we know it?s not. We believe that working at Blendle is the Premier League, the creme de la creme :). That takes it?s toll and asks a lot from your body and mind. These two need time to recharge from your efforts. Make sure to build in moments of absolute rest during the year. It?s called a holiday. Make sure to take 4 weeks, and make sure at least 2 of those are in a row. Advice would be to really go away: studies show that this works best. There are some studies showing that taking regular holidays (every quarter) are very effective. So don?t wait 6 months to take 2 weeks. Also take a week every now and then.
    
    **Don?t work when you?re sick**
    
    When you have the flu, stay at home. Get back to work when you are fully recovered. Don?t feel guilty about it (easier said than done, we know). Yes we miss you, but we can do it without you for a few days. Even better: with you being away, your team might have to rethink how certain things are done in your absence. It can cause a new (maybe better) way for tasks and responsibilities to be distributed and single points of failure can be discovered and fixed.
    
    **Food and exercise**

QUESTION: What's the meaning of life?
=========
Content: **Private life**

Maybe you are in the middle of moving into your dream house or you are trying to get your house sold. Maybe you become a mom or dad, or maybe you really want to. Maybe you just got married or you just went through a rough break up. Maybe you have a lot of debts which are hard to get rid off. Maybe you have an addiction you are struggling with. Maybe you lost someone you love. Whatever it is: it affects your meter and it adds up.

Mapping this out and being aware of this already helps. When becoming aware of a big thing which adds to our stress level, we can see if we can try to fix it. This will not work for everything ? of course, life sucks sometimes. But when in the midst of moving to another house, why not take 2 weeks off and really get it done instead of doing it beside your demanding job? Even the harder obstacles can be worked on. Start by going to the doctor, marriage counseling or a psychologist. It won?t ?fix? the problem instantly of course, but it?s a start. And again: sometimes life sucks.

**Blendle life**

- Working at a startup in survival mode (shifting directions, runway, fixing the product, changing teams)
- Your personal development (new role, changing responsibilities, not a set-in-stone job description)
- Everything happening around you (people leaving and joining, people taking on new responsibilities, changing PM?s and teamleads).

We know this adds to your tally. Again, just becoming aware of this already helps.

Content: **Food and exercise**
    
    Crucial to feeling well, is taking care of your body. Studies show that exercise is crucial when having a demanding job. That doesn?t mean we want you all to be fitgirls and fitboys. But: get moving. Go skating, hiking, biking, surfing, do yoga. Do something. Your body isn?t made to sit in a chair all day. Use the facilities at the office (standing desks and desk bikes) and try to go for a walk every day (is the 1on1-walk a thing yet?). The things you consume also affect this of course, no secrets there. Take care of yourself by consuming good stuff. No rocket science: just more veggies and water, less alcohol and smoking. Take care of yourself.
    
    **When something is wrong: go see a doctor:**
    
    Don?t wait too long to go see a doctor or therapist. It?s very normal to talk to a psychologist or coach every once in awhile. Just as normal as visiting a physiotherapist for back pain because you have an office job.
    
- **Setting priorities right and saying no (I know this is hard)**
    
    
    1. You, your family, friends and loved ones
    2. Blendle
    
    It?s important to know what the right order is. Your health comes first. Your loved ones come first. We want you to pay attention to your number 1 priority and have your private life in order. Because if it?s not, it will add to your stress level.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Nowadays this system is still triggered from time to time, helping you 'survive', but in a slightly different way. At Blendle this system can come in handy when working towards a launch, finishing a feature, picking the best stories, making angry users happy or doing that crucial presentation to get that big ass partnership. At Blendle you will face these moments more than in an average company. This is not only because Blendle is in survival mode, but also because your work carries weight. It matters. In a lot of situations you are solely responsible for a very impactful decision or call. **The stress system will help you perform and get better**. But, there is a big but. Every time you use this system (on purpose or not), you need time to recover and reload.

**Too much of this stress system will drain you** and eventually burn you out. Not if, when.

How much exactly is really hard to determine, because this varies from person to person.

## We push ourselves to grow

As said: stress and pressure is good when it pushes you to come up with something no one ever thought of. We need that to succeed. But too much or too long stress and pressure is counterproductive. This graph paints a pretty clear picture:

Content: **Food and exercise**
    
    Crucial to feeling well, is taking care of your body. Studies show that exercise is crucial when having a demanding job. That doesn?t mean we want you all to be fitgirls and fitboys. But: get moving. Go skating, hiking, biking, surfing, do yoga. Do something. Your body isn?t made to sit in a chair all day. Use the facilities at the office (standing desks and desk bikes) and try to go for a walk every day (is the 1on1-walk a thing yet?). The things you consume also affect this of course, no secrets there. Take care of yourself by consuming good stuff. No rocket science: just more veggies and water, less alcohol and smoking. Take care of yourself.
    
    **When something is wrong: go see a doctor:**
    
    Don?t wait too long to go see a doctor or therapist. It?s very normal to talk to a psychologist or coach every once in awhile. Just as normal as visiting a physiotherapist for back pain because you have an office job.
    
- **Setting priorities right and saying no (I know this is hard)**
    
    
    1. You, your family, friends and loved ones
    2. Blendle
    
    It?s important to know what the right order is. Your health comes first. Your loved ones come first. We want you to pay attention to your number 1 priority and have your private life in order. Because if it?s not, it will add to your stress level.

There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely.  Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? 

Does Blendle benefit from the fact that you are spending time and money on learning and development? 

Does this fit in your personal development path at Blendle? 

Does it match personal goals? 

Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

Would you spend the money on this if it was your own?

**Talk to your Lead, and they will help decide with finance for learning budget requests.**

Content: How does that look? Sometimes it?s better to skip a morning stand-up to visit a physio for your constant headache. You are acting in Blendle?s interest when doing this.
    
- **Check your work, job and role**
    
    
    Are you doing the right job? Do you get energy from what you are doing? Do you feel like you?re making a difference? Do you love most of it? Of course there will be stuff you don?t like, that?s totally normal. But are you doing things you are good at and you like? And is there enough challenge, perspective and room to grow?
    
    Are you getting enough praise and feedback? Do you know what is expected from you? Do you know how you are doing at the moment?
    
    It?s really important that you know how your team and team leads think you are doing. Ask them! What are you doing well, what needs to improve. Use the structure we came up with: 1on1?s, personal goals, feedback sessions, peer reviews. But feel free to alter them in order for them to work for you. Just don?t do nothing.
    
- **Last but not least: get informed.**
    
    There is a lot of information out there. Inform yourself. It will help you recognize a potential threat earlier and help you act on that.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Content: # Personal User Guide

We recently stumbled upon a [Firstround Review blog](http://firstround.com/review/the-indispensable-document-for-the-modern-manager/) about writing a manual for others about yourself. **In short: we advise our leaders at Blendle to write a User Guide for their team members.** The guide is a living and breathing document which gives really concrete pointers on how to work with you. It also gives more context and information about you, so people understand why you do things or act a certain way.

Answering these questions is a quick way to do it. Below are more advanced examples.

Oh, made a guide? Share it with other leads!

# AND Mooooore....

**Recruitment**

This might be one of the most important questions: Who would you like to work with? You might have noticed: we?re expanding! While trying to conquer the world, we need to gather our own army of super-duper extraterrestrial-powered heroes (you know them as your colleagues). We still have a lot of vacancies open? but apart from them, we?re always looking for new recruits. So, do you know anyone fitting the (or a) profile? Let them know we?re looking for ?em or let HR know they need to contact them.

**Business intelligence**

Sounds cool. It is. We want everybody to be informed and make the best decisions possible because all the intel is available. This is also a great way to be transparant. You get all the tools you need and acces to all the data. [Go to this page (made by the BI peeps) and go nuts](https://www.notion.so/8f7739b14e754f7194992ce9b34d0d07) (not public).

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror.

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined.

    **No go's:**

- **Take notes**
    
    'Duhhhh'.
    
    I still see people not taking notes and it's frustrating because your wasting everyone's time. Without notes, all you have to go on is your - pretty biased - memory and gut feeling. You prepared your interview, so write down the answers you get on the questions you thought were crucial to ask. You can use this in during the decisions and actually give examples: 'When I asked X, she answered Y and that testifies that she really understands the concept and did her homework'. 
    
- **Use Ratings**
    
    Ratings quantify the unquantifiable. Force yourself to chose and try to come up with an explanation for that rating. We rate from 1-3 and rate on Work, Drive and fit. 
    Use the profile you made, your notes, the matrix and your overall findings to explain your ratings if need be. 
    
- **Reduce bias**
    
    Everyone is biased. 
    
    Your bias doesn't help you make good decisions and evaluate a person. 
    
    You can reduce bias by:

Content: **Food and exercise**
    
    Crucial to feeling well, is taking care of your body. Studies show that exercise is crucial when having a demanding job. That doesn?t mean we want you all to be fitgirls and fitboys. But: get moving. Go skating, hiking, biking, surfing, do yoga. Do something. Your body isn?t made to sit in a chair all day. Use the facilities at the office (standing desks and desk bikes) and try to go for a walk every day (is the 1on1-walk a thing yet?). The things you consume also affect this of course, no secrets there. Take care of yourself by consuming good stuff. No rocket science: just more veggies and water, less alcohol and smoking. Take care of yourself.
    
    **When something is wrong: go see a doctor:**
    
    Don?t wait too long to go see a doctor or therapist. It?s very normal to talk to a psychologist or coach every once in awhile. Just as normal as visiting a physiotherapist for back pain because you have an office job.
    
- **Setting priorities right and saying no (I know this is hard)**
    
    
    1. You, your family, friends and loved ones
    2. Blendle
    
    It?s important to know what the right order is. Your health comes first. Your loved ones come first. We want you to pay attention to your number 1 priority and have your private life in order. Because if it?s not, it will add to your stress level.

**Snacks and more**

There will be beer, soda and snacks after All-hands presentations. 

On any other regular day:

- We might have chips etc, but op = op. We order snacks sometimes.
- This also goes for the cookies, fizzy drinks, beer or club mate.
- Fruit is something we want to provide everyday. If you notice we run out of fruit too fast and too often, ping our Office Manager so she can fix this.

If you are a big snack lover or don't want to be left empty-handed, consider bringing your own snacks.

---

**Clean up your shit**

You need to clean up your own shit. Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don't forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine. This 'system' works really well and keeps us away from bullshit like dishwasher duty.

Fahima is here every day, twice a day to clean this place, including toilets.

**Think about the environment.**

Kill the lights. Turn down the heating. Don't waste paper #deadtrees. We separate our garbage into paper, glass, plastics and rest. Don't waste food: feel free to take home bread on Friday.

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Content: 2. **Keep teams small.** More then 4-6 people creates more overhead (mainly communication like e-mail/slack and interactions in general) and doesn't necessarily mean that the team performs better. Jeff Bezos calls it the 2 pizza rule (you should be able to feed your team with 2 pizzas) and Ringelmann discovered 'social loafing' in 1914. People unintentionally slack when the group gets too big. Read more about this here:

    3. **Keep budget in mind.** You should focus on getting the best team for the work you need done, but budget does play a role in this. People are our most important and most expensive resource. Hiring, therefore, is an expensive solution to a problem. 
    4. **Plan.** Discuss this step with your lead and HR.
        
        To be able to plan you need these variables: Team, Role, Profile and role description, Hitlist, Priority, Scarceness (1-5), Years of relevant experience, Salary range, Planning. 
        
         Here's an example of a template we've used in the past to plan our hiring Blendle-wide:

**Snacks and more**

There will be beer, soda and snacks after All-hands presentations. 

On any other regular day:

- We might have chips etc, but op = op. We order snacks sometimes.
- This also goes for the cookies, fizzy drinks, beer or club mate.
- Fruit is something we want to provide everyday. If you notice we run out of fruit too fast and too often, ping our Office Manager so she can fix this.

If you are a big snack lover or don't want to be left empty-handed, consider bringing your own snacks.

---

**Clean up your shit**

You need to clean up your own shit. Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don't forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine. This 'system' works really well and keeps us away from bullshit like dishwasher duty.

Fahima is here every day, twice a day to clean this place, including toilets.

**Think about the environment.**

Kill the lights. Turn down the heating. Don't waste paper #deadtrees. We separate our garbage into paper, glass, plastics and rest. Don't waste food: feel free to take home bread on Friday.

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?le is in charge of lunch ??sk her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy.

    Are you getting enough praise and feedback? Do you know what is expected from you? Do you know how you are doing at the moment?
    
    It?s really important that you know how your team and team leads think you are doing. Ask them! What are you doing well, what needs to improve.

Sounds cool. It is. We want everybody to be informed and make the best decisions possible because all the intel is available. This is also a great way to be transparant. You get all the tools you need and acces to all the data. [Go to this page (made by the BI peeps) and go nuts](https://www.notion.so/8f7739b14e754f7194992ce9b34d0d07) (not public).

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: Can you give me some tips for gardening?
=========
Content: When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:
    
    - **It is impossible to work 60 hours productively over a longer period of time.** It hurts you and Blendle to work that much. If you are able to work 8 productive hours a day you should be proud of that. Sometimes it will be 6, sometimes 10: relax, it?s okay, You?re not working in a factory with time stamps.
    - Be flexible. Some days you just don?t have it. **You are not a machine.** Of course, first you?ll take a walk and grab a double espresso or a Club Mate, but if that doesn?t work it?s okay. Go home. Go to the gym. Go play with your kid. Go kiting. Go for a walk in the forest. Anything, just don?t sit behind your desk to ?make the hours?. That?s not helping anybody.
    - Working at home vs. at Blendle HQ. Try to strike a **balance between home/office**. Meetings and brainstorms are best done face to face but a day of deep work is best done in a cafe or on an abandoned island with 4g.
    - **Rotate, change your pace.** During the summer it can be nice to start at 6:30 and bike to the beach at 15.00h. During the winter, every morning might feel like a small hangover and you stroll into HQ at 10:00 after your first 2 cups of coffee.
- **Take care of your body and mind**
    
    
    **Take holidays and days off.**
Source: Notion_DB\Blendle's Employee Handbook a834d55573614857a48a9ce9ec4194e3\Diversity and Inclusion b8d3907631944696a4e76c2a41e757a5\#letstalkaboutstress 26c5eee20f854bb9ac6921f35c9a50b3\What can I do de9fe4bbfc404540a042985ed4e7f85b.md

Content: - **Take care of your body and mind**
    
    
    **Take holidays and days off.**
    
    This one seems obvious, but we know it?s not. We believe that working at Blendle is the Premier League, the creme de la creme :). That takes it?s toll and asks a lot from your body and mind. These two need time to recharge from your efforts. Make sure to build in moments of absolute rest during the year. It?s called a holiday. Make sure to take 4 weeks, and make sure at least 2 of those are in a row. Advice would be to really go away: studies show that this works best. There are some studies showing that taking regular holidays (every quarter) are very effective. So don?t wait 6 months to take 2 weeks. Also take a week every now and then.
    
    **Don?t work when you?re sick**
    
    When you have the flu, stay at home. Get back to work when you are fully recovered. Don?t feel guilty about it (easier said than done, we know). Yes we miss you, but we can do it without you for a few days. Even better: with you being away, your team might have to rethink how certain things are done in your absence. It can cause a new (maybe better) way for tasks and responsibilities to be distributed and single points of failure can be discovered and fixed.
    
    **Food and exercise**
Source: Notion_DB\Blendle's Employee Handbook a834d55573614857a48a9ce9ec4194e3\Diversity and Inclusion b8d3907631944696a4e76c2a41e757a5\#letstalkaboutstress 26c5eee20f854bb9ac6921f35c9a50b3\What can I do de9fe4bbfc404540a042985ed4e7f85b.md

Content: **Food and exercise**
    
    Crucial to feeling well, is taking care of your body. Studies show that exercise is crucial when having a demanding job. That doesn?t mean we want you all to be fitgirls and fitboys. But: get moving. Go skating, hiking, biking, surfing, do yoga. Do something. Your body isn?t made to sit in a chair all day. Use the facilities at the office (standing desks and desk bikes) and try to go for a walk every day (is the 1on1-walk a thing yet?). The things you consume also affect this of course, no secrets there. Take care of yourself by consuming good stuff. No rocket science: just more veggies and water, less alcohol and smoking. Take care of yourself.
    
    **When something is wrong: go see a doctor:**
    
    Don?t wait too long to go see a doctor or therapist. It?s very normal to talk to a psychologist or coach every once in awhile. Just as normal as visiting a physiotherapist for back pain because you have an office job.
    
- **Setting priorities right and saying no (I know this is hard)**
    
    
    1. You, your family, friends and loved ones
    2. Blendle
    
    It?s important to know what the right order is. Your health comes first. Your loved ones come first. We want you to pay attention to your number 1 priority and have your private life in order. Because if it?s not, it will add to your stress level.

FINAL ANSWER:","Here are some tips for gardening:

1. It is impossible to work 60 hours productively over a longer period of time. It's important to find a balance and not overwork yourself.
2. Be flexible and listen to your body. Some days you may not have the energy or motivation to garden, and that's okay. Take breaks and do other activities that bring you joy.
3. Find a balance between gardening at home and at a community garden or other outdoor spaces.
4. Rotate and change your pace. Adjust your gardening schedule based on the season and your personal preferences.
5. Take care of your body and mind. Make sure to take holidays and days off to rest and recharge. Don't work when you're sick and prioritize your health.
6. Pay attention to your diet and exercise regularly. Your body needs movement and nourishment to thrive.
7. If something is wrong, don't hesitate to seek professional help. Consult a doctor or therapist if needed.
8. Set your priorities right and learn to say no. Your health and personal life should always come first.

Alexander and Marten stay in touch and, after seeing the first sketches, Alexander sees the potential and decides to join. Together they have an 'office' in the staircase of the science centre Nemo in Amsterdam. With the prototypes and Alexander on board, the conversations with the publishers actually start to get interesting. Alexander and Marten take all the feedback and criticism from the publishers back to their 'office' and keep improving the product.

In **September 2013,** Blendle received ****100,000 euros from a fund for innovation in journalism.

Content: # History

It's the **28th of April 2014**, the day Blendle was born. Marten and Alexander expected a few friends and partners to show up in an old warehouse in Amsterdam for their 'launch' party. 30 minutes before the start, the room filled with cameras and reporters. More then enough people were interested to see and hear what they came up with. Even PowNews sent a reporter:

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

A little rewind: in 2011, Marten found himself in a bookstore, a bit frustrated, looking at a magazine (as reenacted beautifully in this picture below). He was frustrated that he had to buy the whole magazine, whereas he only wanted to read one article from it. The first idea for Blendle was born and was called MyMagazine. He started talking to a lot of people in the media world, including Alexander. Alexander wasn't convinced yet.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.

QUESTION: What's the best way to learn a new language?
=========
Content: # Learning Budget

There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely.  Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? 

Does Blendle benefit from the fact that you are spending time and money on learning and development? 

Does this fit in your personal development path at Blendle? 

Does it match personal goals? 

Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

Would you spend the money on this if it was your own?

**Talk to your Lead, and they will help decide with finance for learning budget requests.**

Content: - **Take care of your body and mind**
    
    
    **Take holidays and days off.**
    
    This one seems obvious, but we know it?s not. We believe that working at Blendle is the Premier League, the creme de la creme :). That takes it?s toll and asks a lot from your body and mind. These two need time to recharge from your efforts. Make sure to build in moments of absolute rest during the year. It?s called a holiday. Make sure to take 4 weeks, and make sure at least 2 of those are in a row. Advice would be to really go away: studies show that this works best. There are some studies showing that taking regular holidays (every quarter) are very effective. So don?t wait 6 months to take 2 weeks. Also take a week every now and then.
    
    **Don?t work when you?re sick**
    
    When you have the flu, stay at home. Get back to work when you are fully recovered. Don?t feel guilty about it (easier said than done, we know). Yes we miss you, but we can do it without you for a few days. Even better: with you being away, your team might have to rethink how certain things are done in your absence. It can cause a new (maybe better) way for tasks and responsibilities to be distributed and single points of failure can be discovered and fixed.
    
    **Food and exercise**

Content: When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:
    
    - **It is impossible to work 60 hours productively over a longer period of time.** It hurts you and Blendle to work that much. If you are able to work 8 productive hours a day you should be proud of that. Sometimes it will be 6, sometimes 10: relax, it?s okay, You?re not working in a factory with time stamps.
    - Be flexible. Some days you just don?t have it. **You are not a machine.** Of course, first you?ll take a walk and grab a double espresso or a Club Mate, but if that doesn?t work it?s okay. Go home. Go to the gym. Go play with your kid. Go kiting. Go for a walk in the forest. Anything, just don?t sit behind your desk to ?make the hours?. That?s not helping anybody.
    - Working at home vs. at Blendle HQ. Try to strike a **balance between home/office**. Meetings and brainstorms are best done face to face but a day of deep work is best done in a cafe or on an abandoned island with 4g.
    - **Rotate, change your pace.** During the summer it can be nice to start at 6:30 and bike to the beach at 15.00h. During the winter, every morning might feel like a small hangover and you stroll into HQ at 10:00 after your first 2 cups of coffee.

Content: - **Continuous Feedback**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Don?t save up feedback, it?s less powerful. Just speak your mind. The more often you do this, the easier it gets. This goes both ways: good and bad. I never heard someone say he or she got too much feedback.
    
    **How?** 
    
    Face to face is best (e-mail/slack/chat is ok for practical stuff).
    
    Praise in public, feedback 1on1.
    
    Think about:
    
    - quality of work: you did well on X. Because ABC.
    - way of working: you were slow and distracted, how can I help?
    - behaviour: try not to interrupt people during the meeting.
    
    There are a lot of tips out there on how to give feedback.
    
    I like the HIP-approach:
    
    - **H**umble
    - **H**elpful
    - **I**mmediate
    - **I**n person
    - **P**rivate criticism/ **P**ublic Praise
    - Not about **P**ersonality
    
    Source:
    
    [A HIP Approach to Feedback | Achieve Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/a-hip-approach-to-feedback/)
    
- **Have scheduled (bi-)weekly 1on1's**
    
    **Why?**
    
    It?s important and it's not going to happen if you don?t schedule it. If all is fine it might feel too much. It isn?t. Goal is to ?stay in touch? and simply have a relationship with someone. The relationship is the basis for being able to give good feedback and it makes it easier to receive too.
    
    **How?**

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","The best way to learn a new language is to allocate a learning budget and seek approval from the Lead and finance department. Additionally, taking care of one's body and mind, including taking holidays and days off, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle through food and exercise, can contribute to effective language learning. It is also important to establish a balance between working from home and the office, as well as rotating and changing the pace of work. Continuous feedback and scheduled one-on-one meetings can also aid in language learning.

QUESTION: What's your favorite food?
=========
Content: **Food and exercise**
    
    Crucial to feeling well, is taking care of your body. Studies show that exercise is crucial when having a demanding job. That doesn?t mean we want you all to be fitgirls and fitboys. But: get moving. Go skating, hiking, biking, surfing, do yoga. Do something. Your body isn?t made to sit in a chair all day. Use the facilities at the office (standing desks and desk bikes) and try to go for a walk every day (is the 1on1-walk a thing yet?). The things you consume also affect this of course, no secrets there. Take care of yourself by consuming good stuff. No rocket science: just more veggies and water, less alcohol and smoking. Take care of yourself.
    
    **When something is wrong: go see a doctor:**
    
    Don?t wait too long to go see a doctor or therapist. It?s very normal to talk to a psychologist or coach every once in awhile. Just as normal as visiting a physiotherapist for back pain because you have an office job.
    
- **Setting priorities right and saying no (I know this is hard)**
    
    
    1. You, your family, friends and loved ones
    2. Blendle
    
    It?s important to know what the right order is. Your health comes first. Your loved ones come first. We want you to pay attention to your number 1 priority and have your private life in order. Because if it?s not, it will add to your stress level.

**Snacks and more**

There will be beer, soda and snacks after All-hands presentations. 

On any other regular day:

- We might have chips etc, but op = op. We order snacks sometimes.
- This also goes for the cookies, fizzy drinks, beer or club mate.
- Fruit is something we want to provide everyday. If you notice we run out of fruit too fast and too often, ping our Office Manager so she can fix this.

If you are a big snack lover or don't want to be left empty-handed, consider bringing your own snacks.

**Clean up your shit**

You need to clean up your own shit. Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don't forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine. This 'system' works really well and keeps us away from bullshit like dishwasher duty.

Fahima is here every day, twice a day to clean this place, including toilets.

**Think about the environment.**

Kill the lights. Turn down the heating. Don't waste paper #deadtrees. We separate our garbage into paper, glass, plastics and rest. Don't waste food: feel free to take home bread on Friday.

# Our office and everything in it

**Workplace:** 

We have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.

---

**The headphone rule:** 

We don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!

---

**Lunch**

~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Jo?le is in charge of lunch ??sk her if you need anything (allergies for example).

What you can expect from lunch:

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.

**Lunch**

At Blendle we tend to lunch together. Buurtboer arranges nice lunches including sandwiches (to be self-made), salad, eggs and veggies. Just get your plate, walk to the salad bar (yes we got a salad bar from Marktplaats for 100 euros), grab whatever you like and enjoy the company of your colleagues (or don?t, whatever). Any allergies or preferences? Let us know at [officemanagement@blendle.com](mailto:officemanagement@blendle.com).

Don?t be afraid to help out on cleaning up after lunch. You?ll experience this thing called gratitude if you do?

Tough luck! Get over it! No, we care for each other so we will feel sorry for you. And everyone is willing to help out if you get in a tough spot being ill at home. To get the needed help or rest, just let your team lead know you?re staying at home (or going home).

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Alexander and Marten stay in touch and, after seeing the first sketches, Alexander sees the potential and decides to join. Together they have an 'office' in the staircase of the science centre Nemo in Amsterdam. With the prototypes and Alexander on board, the conversations with the publishers actually start to get interesting. Alexander and Marten take all the feedback and criticism from the publishers back to their 'office' and keep improving the product.

In **September 2013,** Blendle received ****100,000 euros from a fund for innovation in journalism.

In the meantime, Blendle got an office upgrade and moved to the Jaarbeurs in the beautiful Utrecht. It looks small in the picture below. It was.

You can park your car [here](http://www.parkeren-utrecht.nl/parkeergarage-moreelsepark). Our Office Manager will get you a parking card asap (if you plan to come by car often). Until then, you can get a get-out-of-parking-stamp with her. Blendle will pay for it.

Or just come by train, we?ll get you a fancy NS business card.

When you enter on your first day, it?s probably best to team up with your teammate/buddy and sit next to or near him or her. Just know that you?re free to sit anywhere you like. Just know that further to the back (behind the meeting rooms) we like to keep things quiet. Just to keep focus :). To improve focus we have one rule called the headphone-rule. Headphones on means ""do not disturb"". Pretty straight-forward, but it works.

Content: # Party and study budget

There is money and time you can spend on celebrating stuff and for learning and development. We want you, as a Team Lead, to feel free to spend this money and time within these boundaries so you don't need permission every time you spend it on these two topics. We want to create clarity so you have the liberty?o spend money on this. We don't want to limit your thinking by coming up with a budget, so feel free to ask HR if you'd like to bend the budgets for a good reason.

You are in the lead for these two topics for your team. 

## Party budget

Apart from the Blendle-wide parties, outings and celebrations, we came up with a number for you to spend on team related stuff. **Every person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on fun stuff.** Why not ?80 or ?20? No good reason, we figured you could go out for dinner twice with your team for ?60. Every person keeps track of this for themselves.  

## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in.""

Content: - When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.
- When people work hard, **poke them** to take time off so they recharge.
- For longer leaves of absence (~4 weeks) ping HR for advice.

**Snacks and more**

There will be beer, soda and snacks after All-hands presentations. 

On any other regular day:

- We might have chips etc, but op = op. We order snacks sometimes.
- This also goes for the cookies, fizzy drinks, beer or club mate.
- Fruit is something we want to provide everyday. If you notice we run out of fruit too fast and too often, ping our Office Manager so she can fix this.

If you are a big snack lover or don't want to be left empty-handed, consider bringing your own snacks.

**Clean up your shit**

You need to clean up your own shit. Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don't forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine. This 'system' works really well and keeps us away from bullshit like dishwasher duty.

Fahima is here every day, twice a day to clean this place, including toilets.

**Think about the environment.**

Kill the lights. Turn down the heating. Don't waste paper #deadtrees. We separate our garbage into paper, glass, plastics and rest. Don't waste food: feel free to take home bread on Friday.

Content: ## **The conversation**

Try initiating an open conversation by scheduling a meet on the first day of return to work, or at least as soon as you can. The purpose behind this conversation is not to judge someone for being absent. But it's meant to uncover the factors behind, or the cause of the absence. There is a good chance that you or Blendle can prevent the next absence by talking about this.

**Explain why you are having this conversation**

- Don't ask right away about the problems and sickness. Make clear that it's about being absent.
- Share a list of dates and patterns relevant to being absent.
- Talk about how the absence worries you, how it effects the team and anyone close to the team member.

**How to and what questions to ask:**

[Google Slides - create and edit presentations online, for free.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11TAG83sZkoXBBGi8pIOVTnYq0fyR5SkzuQUDZN4bQUk/edit#slide=id.p17)

**Notes**

- Always ask open questions.
- Know your facts, this will prevent unnecessary discussions. You can ask HR for the statics.
- Let your team member steer you towards the right solutions, don't fill in the blanks.
- Take notes, set goals and share them with each other afterwards.
- Monitor the progress, have recurring conversations about the situation and the goals.
- There is a fine barrier between being too pushy and being truly engaged and it's normal to feel that dilemma. Just use your own judgement.

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

QUESTION: Tell me about a famous person from history.

Content: Can you tell me about a time you disagreed with a colleague or lead? 
    
    **No go's:** 
    
    Try to stay away from standard questions
    
- **Take notes**
    
    'Duhhhh'.
    
    I still see people not taking notes and it's frustrating because your wasting everyone's time. Without notes, all you have to go on is your - pretty biased - memory and gut feeling. You prepared your interview, so write down the answers you get on the questions you thought were crucial to ask. You can use this in during the decisions and actually give examples: 'When I asked X, she answered Y and that testifies that she really understands the concept and did her homework'. 
    
- **Use Ratings**
    
    Ratings quantify the unquantifiable. Force yourself to chose and try to come up with an explanation for that rating. We rate from 1-3 and rate on Work, Drive and fit. 
    Use the profile you made, your notes, the matrix and your overall findings to explain your ratings if need be. 
    
- **Reduce bias**
    
    Everyone is biased. 
    
    Your bias doesn't help you make good decisions and evaluate a person.

Alexander and Marten stay in touch and, after seeing the first sketches, Alexander sees the potential and decides to join. Together they have an 'office' in the staircase of the science centre Nemo in Amsterdam. With the prototypes and Alexander on board, the conversations with the publishers actually start to get interesting. Alexander and Marten take all the feedback and criticism from the publishers back to their 'office' and keep improving the product.

In **September 2013,** Blendle received ****100,000 euros from a fund for innovation in journalism.

Content: # History

It's the **28th of April 2014**, the day Blendle was born. Marten and Alexander expected a few friends and partners to show up in an old warehouse in Amsterdam for their 'launch' party. 30 minutes before the start, the room filled with cameras and reporters. More then enough people were interested to see and hear what they came up with. Even PowNews sent a reporter:

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

A little rewind: in 2011, Marten found himself in a bookstore, a bit frustrated, looking at a magazine (as reenacted beautifully in this picture below). He was frustrated that he had to buy the whole magazine, whereas he only wanted to read one article from it. The first idea for Blendle was born and was called MyMagazine. He started talking to a lot of people in the media world, including Alexander. Alexander wasn't convinced yet.

In **mid-2012**, Marten asked Jort to make the first sketches and wireframes. 

**June 2012**, these are the first sketches of Blendle:

=========
FINAL ANSWER:","A famous person from history is Alexander, one of the co-founders of Blendle. He played a significant role in the development and success of the company. Blendle is a digital platform for journalism that allows users to pay for individual articles instead of subscribing to entire publications. Alexander and his colleague Marten started Blendle in 2014 and received funding and investments from various sources. They worked on improving the product based on feedback from publishers and eventually gained recognition and success in the media industry.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life.

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22.

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

QUESTION: What's the best way to overcome procrastination?
=========
Content: When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:
    
    - **It is impossible to work 60 hours productively over a longer period of time.** It hurts you and Blendle to work that much. If you are able to work 8 productive hours a day you should be proud of that. Sometimes it will be 6, sometimes 10: relax, it?s okay, You?re not working in a factory with time stamps.
    - Be flexible. Some days you just don?t have it. **You are not a machine.** Of course, first you?ll take a walk and grab a double espresso or a Club Mate, but if that doesn?t work it?s okay. Go home. Go to the gym. Go play with your kid. Go kiting. Go for a walk in the forest. Anything, just don?t sit behind your desk to ?make the hours?. That?s not helping anybody.
    - Working at home vs. at Blendle HQ. Try to strike a **balance between home/office**. Meetings and brainstorms are best done face to face but a day of deep work is best done in a cafe or on an abandoned island with 4g.
    - **Rotate, change your pace.** During the summer it can be nice to start at 6:30 and bike to the beach at 15.00h. During the winter, every morning might feel like a small hangover and you stroll into HQ at 10:00 after your first 2 cups of coffee.
- **Take care of your body and mind**
    
    
    **Take holidays and days off.**

Content: **Food and exercise**
    
    Crucial to feeling well, is taking care of your body. Studies show that exercise is crucial when having a demanding job. That doesn?t mean we want you all to be fitgirls and fitboys. But: get moving. Go skating, hiking, biking, surfing, do yoga. Do something. Your body isn?t made to sit in a chair all day. Use the facilities at the office (standing desks and desk bikes) and try to go for a walk every day (is the 1on1-walk a thing yet?). The things you consume also affect this of course, no secrets there. Take care of yourself by consuming good stuff. No rocket science: just more veggies and water, less alcohol and smoking. Take care of yourself.
    
    **When something is wrong: go see a doctor:**
    
    Don?t wait too long to go see a doctor or therapist. It?s very normal to talk to a psychologist or coach every once in awhile. Just as normal as visiting a physiotherapist for back pain because you have an office job.
    
- **Setting priorities right and saying no (I know this is hard)**
    
    
    1. You, your family, friends and loved ones
    2. Blendle
    
    It?s important to know what the right order is. Your health comes first. Your loved ones come first. We want you to pay attention to your number 1 priority and have your private life in order. Because if it?s not, it will add to your stress level.

Content: # What can I do

**Good news:** you can do something.

# 1. Check yourself:

When looking at all the things stated in chapter 3, you might recognize some stuff. In addition you can fill in this self test: 

[Burnout Self-Test: Are You at Risk?](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTCS_08.htm)

So how are you?

[]()

- I'm good!
    
    Great, take some time to realize why you are doing fine and take measures in order to prevent yourself from getting to stressed.
    
- I?m okay-ish, but something needs to change.
    - Start by telling your team lead that you feel like you have been on your toes for a while and you think you need time to recover. Also tell your team. Also tell HR.
    - Come up with a concrete 2 week plan (we can help you with that) to release some of the first pressure. This will mean a less busy sprint, shorter days, and maybe 2 weeks of 4 days to start with (or a holiday). The hours you gain, you can spend on things you enjoy and help you reload (Netflix, sports, cinema, go to the beach, visit friends, play with model trains). We learned that just doing nothing, doesn?t always help, so make sure to spend time on things you like.
    - During these two weeks you check in with your team lead how your stress level is. You can make it really concrete by giving your stress level a number (1-10).

Content: **Private life**

Maybe you are in the middle of moving into your dream house or you are trying to get your house sold. Maybe you become a mom or dad, or maybe you really want to. Maybe you just got married or you just went through a rough break up. Maybe you have a lot of debts which are hard to get rid off. Maybe you have an addiction you are struggling with. Maybe you lost someone you love. Whatever it is: it affects your meter and it adds up.

Mapping this out and being aware of this already helps. When becoming aware of a big thing which adds to our stress level, we can see if we can try to fix it. This will not work for everything ? of course, life sucks sometimes. But when in the midst of moving to another house, why not take 2 weeks off and really get it done instead of doing it beside your demanding job? Even the harder obstacles can be worked on. Start by going to the doctor, marriage counseling or a psychologist. It won?t ?fix? the problem instantly of course, but it?s a start. And again: sometimes life sucks.

**Blendle life**

- Working at a startup in survival mode (shifting directions, runway, fixing the product, changing teams)
- Your personal development (new role, changing responsibilities, not a set-in-stone job description)
- Everything happening around you (people leaving and joining, people taking on new responsibilities, changing PM?s and teamleads).

We know this adds to your tally. Again, just becoming aware of this already helps.

FINAL ANSWER:","The best way to overcome procrastination is to prioritize self-care, set boundaries, and seek support when needed. This includes taking breaks, exercising, seeking medical help if necessary, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance. It is also important to set priorities and say no when necessary. Additionally, creating a plan and seeking assistance from team leads and HR can help alleviate stress and prevent burnout.

**Recruitment**

This might be one of the most important questions: Who would you like to work with? You might have noticed: we?re expanding! While trying to conquer the world, we need to gather our own army of super-duper extraterrestrial-powered heroes (you know them as your colleagues).

Let them know we?re looking for ?em or let HR know they need to contact them.

**Business intelligence**

Sounds cool. It is. We want everybody to be informed and make the best decisions possible because all the intel is available. This is also a great way to be transparant. You get all the tools you need and acces to all the data. [Go to this page (made by the BI peeps) and go nuts](https://www.notion.so/8f7739b14e754f7194992ce9b34d0d07) (not public).

# **Part 3: Let?s intro the shit out of this:**

Content: - Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

**Snacks and more**

There will be beer, soda and snacks after All-hands presentations. 

On any other regular day:

- We might have chips etc, but op = op. We order snacks sometimes.
- This also goes for the cookies, fizzy drinks, beer or club mate.
- Fruit is something we want to provide everyday. If you notice we run out of fruit too fast and too often, ping our Office Manager so she can fix this.

If you are a big snack lover or don't want to be left empty-handed, consider bringing your own snacks.

**Clean up your shit**

You need to clean up your own shit. Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don't forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine. This 'system' works really well and keeps us away from bullshit like dishwasher duty.

Fahima is here every day, twice a day to clean this place, including toilets.

**Think about the environment.**

Kill the lights. Turn down the heating. Don't waste paper #deadtrees. We separate our garbage into paper, glass, plastics and rest. Don't waste food: feel free to take home bread on Friday.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

QUESTION: Can you give me some fashion advice?
=========
Content: **Food and exercise**
    
    Crucial to feeling well, is taking care of your body. Studies show that exercise is crucial when having a demanding job. That doesn?t mean we want you all to be fitgirls and fitboys. But: get moving. Go skating, hiking, biking, surfing, do yoga. Do something. Your body isn?t made to sit in a chair all day. Use the facilities at the office (standing desks and desk bikes) and try to go for a walk every day (is the 1on1-walk a thing yet?). The things you consume also affect this of course, no secrets there. Take care of yourself by consuming good stuff. No rocket science: just more veggies and water, less alcohol and smoking. Take care of yourself.
    
    **When something is wrong: go see a doctor:**
    
    Don?t wait too long to go see a doctor or therapist. It?s very normal to talk to a psychologist or coach every once in awhile. Just as normal as visiting a physiotherapist for back pain because you have an office job.
    
- **Setting priorities right and saying no (I know this is hard)**
    
    
    1. You, your family, friends and loved ones
    2. Blendle
    
    It?s important to know what the right order is. Your health comes first. Your loved ones come first. We want you to pay attention to your number 1 priority and have your private life in order. Because if it?s not, it will add to your stress level.

    'Duhhhh'.
    
    I still see people not taking notes and it's frustrating because your wasting everyone's time. Without notes, all you have to go on is your - pretty biased - memory and gut feeling. You prepared your interview, so write down the answers you get on the questions you thought were crucial to ask. You can use this in during the decisions and actually give examples: 'When I asked X, she answered Y and that testifies that she really understands the concept and did her homework'. 
    
- **Use Ratings**
    
    Ratings quantify the unquantifiable. Force yourself to chose and try to come up with an explanation for that rating. We rate from 1-3 and rate on Work, Drive and fit.

    This one seems obvious, but we know it?s not. We believe that working at Blendle is the Premier League, the creme de la creme :). That takes it?s toll and asks a lot from your body and mind. These two need time to recharge from your efforts. Make sure to build in moments of absolute rest during the year. It?s called a holiday. Make sure to take 4 weeks, and make sure at least 2 of those are in a row. Advice would be to really go away: studies show that this works best. There are some studies showing that taking regular holidays (every quarter) are very effective. So don?t wait 6 months to take 2 weeks. Also take a week every now and then.
    
    **Don?t work when you?re sick**
    
    When you have the flu, stay at home. Get back to work when you are fully recovered. Don?t feel guilty about it (easier said than done, we know). Yes we miss you, but we can do it without you for a few days. Even better: with you being away, your team might have to rethink how certain things are done in your absence. It can cause a new (maybe better) way for tasks and responsibilities to be distributed and single points of failure can be discovered and fixed.

QUESTION: What's the best way to start a small business?

Content: 2. **Keep teams small.** More then 4-6 people creates more overhead (mainly communication like e-mail/slack and interactions in general) and doesn't necessarily mean that the team performs better. Jeff Bezos calls it the 2 pizza rule (you should be able to feed your team with 2 pizzas) and Ringelmann discovered 'social loafing' in 1914. People unintentionally slack when the group gets too big.

Content: # Intro: two things you should know

When working at Blendle, there are a few things you should know. Not to scare you. It is just something to be aware of.

## **1. Blendle is a startup**

Blendle is a startup. Your salary (and all benefits) is paid from money from investors. You (and the people you work with) are part of the solution to the problem we are trying to solve. Time lost or wasted is bad, because it doesn?t bring us closer to the goal: supporting quality journalism. We need money to do so. Finding the right product-market fit (building a freaking beautiful product which the whole world wants to use) and becoming profitable is crucial to reaching the end goal.

We tend to say to people (imagine a smile on our face): ?Hey, but no pressure!?, and then we both start to laugh (or else it is awkward). Well let me say this once, loud and clear: we realise that there is pressure. It can be pretty intense. This is not a regular corporate day job, and that has its up- and downsides. Example upside: we don?t care where and when you work, which means flexibility. Example downside: you have to be able to regulate yourself, which can be hard.

There are a lot of product/business choices made because of this survival mode. Some you might like (a lot of freedom and responsibility in your work), some you might dislike (pressure on shipping, for example). **Bottom line: survival mode results in a fast-paced, high-pressure, sometimes hectic/chaotic environment.**

Content: # Hiring

Getting new people to join Blendle is a **high effort, high impact** thing to do. The reward is huge, when you see the people you hired adding value to the company. Imagine not hiring that person: that new idea, design, piece of code, algorithm or audio show would not have been there. Your hire could be key to the succes of Blendle: that's a lot of impact. The other side of the same coin is that it's high effort too. These 4 pointers will help you get started. 

- **Personnel planning**
    
    Planning the number and type of people you need in the future is hard but also crucial. Hiring people takes time (~3 months), so looking ahead is important for making your projects succeed. Without the right (number of) people, it's hard to build a cool product.
    
    When making plans for **the coming and next quarter:**
    
    1. **Determine what work needs to be done, looking 6-12 months ahead, and decide if we have enough resources to do so.** 
        
        Our basic premise is that we work with the team we have and we hire reactively. But ask yourself a few questions. Do you have the right number and type of people? What kind of skills, expertise, experience do you need in what amount? What can we fix internally? What can we teach the people who are at Blendle? What can we just try with advice from outside? Is your ask temporary or permanent? How is the current workload? Can we afford to ship less quickly?

Content: Here's a basic structure that could help you and cover the basics, but make sure to actually prepare your interviews, don't wing it. You're wasting someone's time if you do.
    
    Here's an outline, you can shuffle the blocks of course. At Blendle we like a pretty loose style of interviewing, so freewheel within the structure, just make sure you tick the most important boxes. It's a compass, not a GPS.
    
    I**ntro (3 min)**
    
    ? Create relaxed atmosphere. Chitchat, but don't overdo it.
    
    **Talk about Blendle  (10 min)**
    
    ? Sell the Blendle story, answer questions.
    
    **Talk about resume (5 min)**
    
    ? Keep it short, ask if someone can give you a 1 minutes pitch about their resume (since you already read it). This is a nice start because people expect this, so they can get in their flow before you really dig in.
    
    **Talk about the job (10 min)**
    
    ? Explain the role, the position, the responsibilities, the challenges and answer questions. Check if someone really understands and is still interested.
    
    **Check work/drive/fit (25 min)**
    
    ? Check work (is someone capable of doing the job? Does he/she have the right skills, knowledge, expertise and experience)
    
    ? Check drive (is someone eager, ambitious and willing? Is someone motivated to work for Blendle?)
    
    ? Check fit (would someone fit in the current team and company? DNA/culture match?)

FINAL ANSWER:","The best way to start a small business is to keep teams small, keep budget in mind, and plan ahead for personnel needs. It is important to have a small team to minimize overhead and ensure effective communication. Budget considerations should be taken into account when hiring, as people are the most important and expensive resource. Planning ahead for personnel needs is crucial for the success of projects and the overall growth of the business. This includes determining the number and type of people needed, assessing skills and expertise required, and considering the current workload and ability to ship products. When conducting interviews, it is important to create a relaxed atmosphere, discuss the company and job role, and assess work capabilities, drive, and fit with the team and company culture.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Entrance code: [here](https://www.notion.so/8354943cbce846e086ad48e67dc153bc)

You can park your car [here](http://www.parkeren-utrecht.nl/parkeergarage-moreelsepark). Our Office Manager will get you a parking card asap (if you plan to come by car often). Until then, you can get a get-out-of-parking-stamp with her. Blendle will pay for it.

Or just come by train, we?ll get you a fancy NS business card.

When you enter on your first day, it?s probably best to team up with your teammate/buddy and sit next to or near him or her. Just know that you?re free to sit anywhere you like. Just know that further to the back (behind the meeting rooms) we like to keep things quiet. Just to keep focus :). To improve focus we have one rule called the headphone-rule. Headphones on means ""do not disturb"". Pretty straight-forward, but it works.

**Snacks and more**

There will be beer, soda and snacks after All-hands presentations. 

On any other regular day:

- We might have chips etc, but op = op. We order snacks sometimes.
- This also goes for the cookies, fizzy drinks, beer or club mate.
- Fruit is something we want to provide everyday. If you notice we run out of fruit too fast and too often, ping our Office Manager so she can fix this.

If you are a big snack lover or don't want to be left empty-handed, consider bringing your own snacks.

**Clean up your shit**

You need to clean up your own shit. Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don't forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine. This 'system' works really well and keeps us away from bullshit like dishwasher duty.

Fahima is here every day, twice a day to clean this place, including toilets.

**Think about the environment.**

Kill the lights. Turn down the heating. Don't waste paper #deadtrees. We separate our garbage into paper, glass, plastics and rest. Don't waste food: feel free to take home bread on Friday.

Nowadays this system is still triggered from time to time, helping you 'survive', but in a slightly different way. At Blendle this system can come in handy when working towards a launch, finishing a feature, picking the best stories, making angry users happy or doing that crucial presentation to get that big ass partnership. At Blendle you will face these moments more than in an average company. This is not only because Blendle is in survival mode, but also because your work carries weight. It matters. In a lot of situations you are solely responsible for a very impactful decision or call. **The stress system will help you perform and get better**. But, there is a big but. Every time you use this system (on purpose or not), you need time to recover and reload.

**Too much of this stress system will drain you** and eventually burn you out. Not if, when.

How much exactly is really hard to determine, because this varies from person to person.

## We push ourselves to grow

As said: stress and pressure is good when it pushes you to come up with something no one ever thought of. We need that to succeed. But too much or too long stress and pressure is counterproductive. This graph paints a pretty clear picture:

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

QUESTION: How can I improve my photography skills?
=========
Content: How does that look? Sometimes it?s better to skip a morning stand-up to visit a physio for your constant headache. You are acting in Blendle?s interest when doing this.
    
- **Check your work, job and role**
    
    
    Are you doing the right job? Do you get energy from what you are doing? Do you feel like you?re making a difference? Do you love most of it? Of course there will be stuff you don?t like, that?s totally normal. But are you doing things you are good at and you like? And is there enough challenge, perspective and room to grow?
    
    Are you getting enough praise and feedback? Do you know what is expected from you? Do you know how you are doing at the moment?
    
    It?s really important that you know how your team and team leads think you are doing. Ask them! What are you doing well, what needs to improve. Use the structure we came up with: 1on1?s, personal goals, feedback sessions, peer reviews. But feel free to alter them in order for them to work for you. Just don?t do nothing.
    
- **Last but not least: get informed.**
    
    There is a lot of information out there. Inform yourself. It will help you recognize a potential threat earlier and help you act on that. 
    
    Going to the [**Good Reads**](Good%20reads%20e975bced442d483c8c510d54e958444d.md) page is a great place to start :).

Content: # What can I do

**Good news:** you can do something.

# 1. Check yourself:

When looking at all the things stated in chapter 3, you might recognize some stuff. In addition you can fill in this self test: 

[Burnout Self-Test: Are You at Risk?](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTCS_08.htm)

So how are you?

[]()

- I'm good!
    
    Great, take some time to realize why you are doing fine and take measures in order to prevent yourself from getting to stressed.
    
- I?m okay-ish, but something needs to change.
    - Start by telling your team lead that you feel like you have been on your toes for a while and you think you need time to recover. Also tell your team. Also tell HR.
    - Come up with a concrete 2 week plan (we can help you with that) to release some of the first pressure. This will mean a less busy sprint, shorter days, and maybe 2 weeks of 4 days to start with (or a holiday). The hours you gain, you can spend on things you enjoy and help you reload (Netflix, sports, cinema, go to the beach, visit friends, play with model trains). We learned that just doing nothing, doesn?t always help, so make sure to spend time on things you like.
    - During these two weeks you check in with your team lead how your stress level is. You can make it really concrete by giving your stress level a number (1-10).

Content: ? **Tips for giving useful feedback**

</aside>

![Our%20Feedback%20Process%20c40fc80d546045ffb7076797301e81a8/Untitled.png](Our%20Feedback%20Process%20c40fc80d546045ffb7076797301e81a8/Untitled.png)

- Don?t save all your feedback up - give at the time of the event (or shortly after) -  There should be no surprises
- Don't make it personal.  Focus on the situation not the person. and how you can work together to improve it for next time.
- Examples are fine, but don't use them for the blame game.
- Reflect on your intention in giving someone your feedback. Are you giving it to help someone or to shame someone?  Did you have a role in the situation that happened?
- Be clear and direct, subtle gibberish doesn't help anyone.
- Remember A-P-P-R-E-C-I-A-T-I-O-N helps motivate and shows people their unique value.

<aside>
? Tips for r**eceiving feedback**

</aside>

- Always assume feedback is given to help you
- Be open to listening and don't get stuck in a spiral of defending or pointing fingers back.
Take responsibility if something went wrong and focus on learning how to work together better.
- Be curious - Why is this feedback given to you? What is really at the root of it?  Is it the feedback itself that indicates a problem or is some emotion underlying it that needs to be addressed?

Content: - **Continuous Feedback**
    
    **Why?** 
    
    Don?t save up feedback, it?s less powerful. Just speak your mind. The more often you do this, the easier it gets. This goes both ways: good and bad. I never heard someone say he or she got too much feedback.
    
    **How?** 
    
    Face to face is best (e-mail/slack/chat is ok for practical stuff).
    
    Praise in public, feedback 1on1.
    
    Think about:
    
    - quality of work: you did well on X. Because ABC.
    - way of working: you were slow and distracted, how can I help?
    - behaviour: try not to interrupt people during the meeting.
    
    There are a lot of tips out there on how to give feedback.
    
    I like the HIP-approach:
    
    - **H**umble
    - **H**elpful
    - **I**mmediate
    - **I**n person
    - **P**rivate criticism/ **P**ublic Praise
    - Not about **P**ersonality
    
    Source:
    
    [A HIP Approach to Feedback | Achieve Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/a-hip-approach-to-feedback/)
    
- **Have scheduled (bi-)weekly 1on1's**
    
    **Why?**
    
    It?s important and it's not going to happen if you don?t schedule it. If all is fine it might feel too much. It isn?t. Goal is to ?stay in touch? and simply have a relationship with someone. The relationship is the basis for being able to give good feedback and it makes it easier to receive too.
    
    **How?**

**Snacks and more**

There will be beer, soda and snacks after All-hands presentations. 

On any other regular day:

- We might have chips etc, but op = op. We order snacks sometimes.
- This also goes for the cookies, fizzy drinks, beer or club mate.
- Fruit is something we want to provide everyday. If you notice we run out of fruit too fast and too often, ping our Office Manager so she can fix this.

If you are a big snack lover or don't want to be left empty-handed, consider bringing your own snacks.

**Clean up your shit**

You need to clean up your own shit. Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don't forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine. This 'system' works really well and keeps us away from bullshit like dishwasher duty.

Fahima is here every day, twice a day to clean this place, including toilets.

**Think about the environment.**

Kill the lights. Turn down the heating. Don't waste paper #deadtrees. We separate our garbage into paper, glass, plastics and rest. Don't waste food: feel free to take home bread on Friday.

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.

FINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.

QUESTION: Can you recommend a good workout routine?
=========
Content: **Food and exercise**
    
    Crucial to feeling well, is taking care of your body. Studies show that exercise is crucial when having a demanding job. That doesn?t mean we want you all to be fitgirls and fitboys. But: get moving. Go skating, hiking, biking, surfing, do yoga. Do something. Your body isn?t made to sit in a chair all day. Use the facilities at the office (standing desks and desk bikes) and try to go for a walk every day (is the 1on1-walk a thing yet?). The things you consume also affect this of course, no secrets there. Take care of yourself by consuming good stuff. No rocket science: just more veggies and water, less alcohol and smoking. Take care of yourself.
    
    **When something is wrong: go see a doctor:**
    
    Don?t wait too long to go see a doctor or therapist. It?s very normal to talk to a psychologist or coach every once in awhile. Just as normal as visiting a physiotherapist for back pain because you have an office job.
    
- **Setting priorities right and saying no (I know this is hard)**
    
    
    1. You, your family, friends and loved ones
    2. Blendle
    
    It?s important to know what the right order is. Your health comes first. Your loved ones come first. We want you to pay attention to your number 1 priority and have your private life in order. Because if it?s not, it will add to your stress level.

Content: How does that look? Sometimes it?s better to skip a morning stand-up to visit a physio for your constant headache. You are acting in Blendle?s interest when doing this.
    
- **Check your work, job and role**
    
    
    Are you doing the right job? Do you get energy from what you are doing? Do you feel like you?re making a difference? Do you love most of it? Of course there will be stuff you don?t like, that?s totally normal. But are you doing things you are good at and you like? And is there enough challenge, perspective and room to grow?
    
    Are you getting enough praise and feedback? Do you know what is expected from you? Do you know how you are doing at the moment?
    
    It?s really important that you know how your team and team leads think you are doing. Ask them! What are you doing well, what needs to improve. Use the structure we came up with: 1on1?s, personal goals, feedback sessions, peer reviews. But feel free to alter them in order for them to work for you. Just don?t do nothing.
    
- **Last but not least: get informed.**
    
    There is a lot of information out there. Inform yourself. It will help you recognize a potential threat earlier and help you act on that. 
    
    Going to the [**Good Reads**](Good%20reads%20e975bced442d483c8c510d54e958444d.md) page is a great place to start :).

Content: When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:
    
    - **It is impossible to work 60 hours productively over a longer period of time.** It hurts you and Blendle to work that much. If you are able to work 8 productive hours a day you should be proud of that. Sometimes it will be 6, sometimes 10: relax, it?s okay, You?re not working in a factory with time stamps.
    - Be flexible. Some days you just don?t have it. **You are not a machine.** Of course, first you?ll take a walk and grab a double espresso or a Club Mate, but if that doesn?t work it?s okay. Go home. Go to the gym. Go play with your kid. Go kiting. Go for a walk in the forest. Anything, just don?t sit behind your desk to ?make the hours?. That?s not helping anybody.
    - Working at home vs. at Blendle HQ. Try to strike a **balance between home/office**. Meetings and brainstorms are best done face to face but a day of deep work is best done in a cafe or on an abandoned island with 4g.
    - **Rotate, change your pace.** During the summer it can be nice to start at 6:30 and bike to the beach at 15.00h. During the winter, every morning might feel like a small hangover and you stroll into HQ at 10:00 after your first 2 cups of coffee.
- **Take care of your body and mind**
    
    
    **Take holidays and days off.**

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

You can park your car [here](http://www.parkeren-utrecht.nl/parkeergarage-moreelsepark). Our Office Manager will get you a parking card asap (if you plan to come by car often). Until then, you can get a get-out-of-parking-stamp with her. Blendle will pay for it.

Or just come by train, we?ll get you a fancy NS business card.

When you enter on your first day, it?s probably best to team up with your teammate/buddy and sit next to or near him or her. Just know that you?re free to sit anywhere you like. Just know that further to the back (behind the meeting rooms) we like to keep things quiet. Just to keep focus :). To improve focus we have one rule called the headphone-rule. Headphones on means ""do not disturb"". Pretty straight-forward, but it works.

QUESTION: Tell me a riddle.
=========
Content: **You have the responsibility to find out what rhythm works for you best, to be at your best.** Simply because we believe not everybody works the same way. So do you have the rhythm which works best for you? We want everybody to be able to bring their child, cat or car to daycare. Not because we love cats in particular (yes we do), but we want nothing to get in your way of getting the most out of your day. The fact that we don?t care when and how many times you go to a doctor, psych or barber is not because we want to be the ?cool employer?, but because you need your health to add value that day. So if that means visiting the barber once a week on Monday morning: please do.
    
    So have you found your rhythm yet? Rolo hates traffic jams so you?ll see him coming and going at exotic times. Alex is scrolling through his Twitter feed till late at night so you won't see him before 11:00 at the office. Rick?s alarm clock is set at 6:00 and we know he doesn?t snooze, so he?s in at 8:00, leaving early to have dinner with his wife.
    
    It might help announcing changes in your rythm to your team. It makes it feel legit for you, and your team members can help you with it.
    
    When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:

Content: - Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.
    - **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.
5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.
6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing. You can do someone a favour by telling them the time has come to move on. This is the part where you signal HR, Rick and Alex that both parties tried everything but you think it's best to part ways. They will help you through the process.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming.

QUESTION: What's the best way to save money?
=========
Content: ## Study budget

""There is money on our bank account and it?s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it?s reasonable if Blendle pitches in."" 

The question is rather simple: is it a good investment? We spend our money wisely, so we consider the pro's and con's. Does Blendle benefit from the fact that someone is spending time and money on learning and development? There is a big chance the answer is yes, but it's important to make it concrete how. Does this fit in someones personal development path at Blendle? Does it match the personal goals? Does it match the role and responsibilities? 

A good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own. The rest is common sense.

As leads you can decide to say Yes or No to budget requests based on the above questions. If you need help deciding, you can discuss with HR.

**?0-?250** = no study contract. Like a cool book, online course or a ticket to a summit.

**?250-1500 =** 12 months study contract. Like a full blown study/course or a conference (abroad).

**?1500** = edge case with 24 months study contract, please discuss with HR.

Content: **Food and exercise**
    
    Crucial to feeling well, is taking care of your body. Studies show that exercise is crucial when having a demanding job. That doesn?t mean we want you all to be fitgirls and fitboys. But: get moving. Go skating, hiking, biking, surfing, do yoga. Do something. Your body isn?t made to sit in a chair all day. Use the facilities at the office (standing desks and desk bikes) and try to go for a walk every day (is the 1on1-walk a thing yet?). The things you consume also affect this of course, no secrets there. Take care of yourself by consuming good stuff. No rocket science: just more veggies and water, less alcohol and smoking. Take care of yourself.
    
    **When something is wrong: go see a doctor:**
    
    Don?t wait too long to go see a doctor or therapist. It?s very normal to talk to a psychologist or coach every once in awhile. Just as normal as visiting a physiotherapist for back pain because you have an office job.
    
- **Setting priorities right and saying no (I know this is hard)**
    
    
    1. You, your family, friends and loved ones
    2. Blendle
    
    It?s important to know what the right order is. Your health comes first. Your loved ones come first. We want you to pay attention to your number 1 priority and have your private life in order. Because if it?s not, it will add to your stress level.

Content: # Party and study budget

There is money and time you can spend on celebrating stuff and for learning and development. We want you, as a Team Lead, to feel free to spend this money and time within these boundaries so you don't need permission every time you spend it on these two topics. We want to create clarity so you have the liberty?o spend money on this. We don't want to limit your thinking by coming up with a budget, so feel free to ask HR if you'd like to bend the budgets for a good reason.

You are in the lead for these two topics for your team. 

## Party budget

Apart from the Blendle-wide parties, outings and celebrations, we came up with a number for you to spend on team related stuff. **Every person at Blendle has ?60 per year to spend on fun stuff.** Why not ?80 or ?20? No good reason, we figured you could go out for dinner twice with your team for ?60. Every person keeps track of this for themselves.

- **Take notes**
    
    'Duhhhh'.
    
    I still see people not taking notes and it's frustrating because your wasting everyone's time. Without notes, all you have to go on is your - pretty biased - memory and gut feeling. You prepared your interview, so write down the answers you get on the questions you thought were crucial to ask. You can use this in during the decisions and actually give examples: 'When I asked X, she answered Y and that testifies that she really understands the concept and did her homework'. 
    
- **Use Ratings**
    
    Ratings quantify the unquantifiable. Force yourself to chose and try to come up with an explanation for that rating. We rate from 1-3 and rate on Work, Drive and fit. 
    Use the profile you made, your notes, the matrix and your overall findings to explain your ratings if need be.

    **Why?** 
    
    Don?t save up feedback, it?s less powerful. Just speak your mind. The more often you do this, the easier it gets. This goes both ways: good and bad. I never heard someone say he or she got too much feedback.
    
    **How?** 
    
    Face to face is best (e-mail/slack/chat is ok for practical stuff).
    
    Praise in public, feedback 1on1.
    
    Think about:
    
    - quality of work: you did well on X. Because ABC.
    - way of working: you were slow and distracted, how can I help?
    - behaviour: try not to interrupt people during the meeting.
    
    There are a lot of tips out there on how to give feedback.
    
    I like the HIP-approach:
    
    - **H**umble
    - **H**elpful
    - **I**mmediate
    - **I**n person

- **Have scheduled (bi-)weekly 1on1's**
    
    **Why?**
    
    It?s important and it's not going to happen if you don?t schedule it. If all is fine it might feel too much. It isn?t. Goal is to ?stay in touch? and simply have a relationship with someone. The relationship is the basis for being able to give good feedback and it makes it easier to receive too.

Content: **How?** 
    
    It works best if you have a standard agenda for this meeting. I would not recommend winging it every time. 
    
    [re:Work - Guide: Coach managers to coach](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-coach-managers-to-coach/steps/hold-effective-1-1-meetings/)
    
    Here?s an outline we like.
    
    - Personal: How are you feeling today? Why is that? What?s going on in your life at the moment? What?s on your mind?
    - Work: What are you working on? What do you like/dislike? Any roadblocks/issues?
    - Feedback and coaching: Share the feedback you wrote down. Do you have any feedback for me?
    - Goals: How are you progressing on your personal goals? Need help?
    
    *Review action points last week and make new ones*
    
    I would recommend asking your team member to come up with an agenda, to also make them feel they are in control and in the lead.
    
    Last but not least: take 15-30 minutes to prepare. Both parties shouldn?t accept the meeting going forward without preparing.
    
    We can highly recommend listening to this three part course from Manager Tools on 1:1?s. It's sometimes a bit cheesy (including the theme music) but the contents are very much worth it.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

So how are you?

[]()

- I'm good!
    
    Great, take some time to realize why you are doing fine and take measures in order to prevent yourself from getting to stressed.
    
- I?m okay-ish, but something needs to change.
    - Start by telling your team lead that you feel like you have been on your toes for a while and you think you need time to recover. Also tell your team. Also tell HR.
    - Come up with a concrete 2 week plan (we can help you with that) to release some of the first pressure. This will mean a less busy sprint, shorter days, and maybe 2 weeks of 4 days to start with (or a holiday). The hours you gain, you can spend on things you enjoy and help you reload (Netflix, sports, cinema, go to the beach, visit friends, play with model trains). We learned that just doing nothing, doesn?t always help, so make sure to spend time on things you like.
    - During these two weeks you check in with your team lead how your stress level is. You can make it really concrete by giving your stress level a number (1-10).

There is so. much. good. stuff out there. The Blendle library is a virtual and physical place to share good reads/listens/watches. 

Let your inner nerd out!

- **The physical library(tje)**
    
    We?ve got 4 shelves reserved next to the LINDA for good books to share and loan. As you can see we have a lot of room, so feel free to come up with suggestions on what books to buy or bring a book you want to share. We have two 'empty' sections, so go ahead and fill them if you want to. 
    
- **The virtual library**
    
    Again, there is so much good stuff out there. The virtual library is a way to not let it go to waste and share good stuff we see online.
    
    Here is how it works: you read, hear, watch something great: share and recommend it here. The other way around: you get to see what your colleagues read and can be inspired by it.
    
    If you are on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/), you could also join the private [Blendle group](https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/159991-blendle) (requires approval of one of the group moderators).

QUESTION: What's the best way to reduce stress?
=========
Content: **Food and exercise**
    
    Crucial to feeling well, is taking care of your body. Studies show that exercise is crucial when having a demanding job. That doesn?t mean we want you all to be fitgirls and fitboys. But: get moving. Go skating, hiking, biking, surfing, do yoga. Do something. Your body isn?t made to sit in a chair all day. Use the facilities at the office (standing desks and desk bikes) and try to go for a walk every day (is the 1on1-walk a thing yet?). The things you consume also affect this of course, no secrets there. Take care of yourself by consuming good stuff. No rocket science: just more veggies and water, less alcohol and smoking. Take care of yourself.
    
    **When something is wrong: go see a doctor:**
    
    Don?t wait too long to go see a doctor or therapist. It?s very normal to talk to a psychologist or coach every once in awhile. Just as normal as visiting a physiotherapist for back pain because you have an office job.
    
- **Setting priorities right and saying no (I know this is hard)**
    
    
    1. You, your family, friends and loved ones
    2. Blendle
    
    It?s important to know what the right order is. Your health comes first. Your loved ones come first. We want you to pay attention to your number 1 priority and have your private life in order. Because if it?s not, it will add to your stress level.

    - Once you feel reloaded, we (you, teamlead and HR if you like) need to talk about the factors that caused your stress level to rise and see how we can prevent this from happening again.
- I?m not good. I recognize the symptoms and I?m on the verge of burning out.
    - Don?t wait, speak up now. Tell your team lead, tell Rolo/HR.
    - We have (external) professionals who are experts on this topic. We can put you in touch with them. They know Blendle and the environment and they will be able to get you back on track. Our advice would be to talk to us first, but if you feel you can?t do that for whatever reason: contact Martijn ten Bokum from Arbobutler: m.ten.bokum@arbobutler.nl.
    - Depending on your case and your problems, we (together with the people from Arbobutler) come up with a tailor made plan, based on what you need. This could involve some time off, working less or talking to a job coach.

# 2. Be aware

You can start with dividing your life into different parts. Think of: family, work, colleagues, sports, hobby, voluntary work. Once you have a clear overview of all the different areas, think about whether it adds to your stress level and if there are ways to change things. Let's zoom in a bit further:

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. 

He met the Ukrainian people. 

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. 

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won?t stop. 

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. 

Let?s use this moment to reset. Let?s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  

Let?s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  

We can?t change how divided we?ve been. But we can change how we move forward?on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who?d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I?ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. 

And I?m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia?s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. 

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what?s happening can seem alarming. 

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. 

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

Content: # What is stress

## Basic stress system

Stress is different for everybody and therefore hard to grasp, but the fundamentals are somewhat the same. It all starts between your ears: yup, your brain. On a real basic (biological) level, your brain reacts to situations by unleashing certain substances in your head and body. These substances make your body ready for **fight or flight**. This system is great when you for example need to run from a lion or bear. Your body and mind go into survival mode, giving you extra strength, extra endurance and extra focus. **Back in the day, it was a great way to survive.**

> We call this the fight-or-flight response, and while this once incredibly important response was evolutionarily adaptive, it is now maladaptive. We don?t live in that same world anymore where it made so much sense. We aren?t being chased down by lions or being eaten by wolves while sitting in front of our computers in our air-conditioned offices, and yet our fight-or-flight responses are still being activated.

Officer Rivera was 22.

QUESTION: Do you have any tips for time management?
=========
Content: When rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:
    
    - **It is impossible to work 60 hours productively over a longer period of time.** It hurts you and Blendle to work that much. If you are able to work 8 productive hours a day you should be proud of that. Sometimes it will be 6, sometimes 10: relax, it?s okay, You?re not working in a factory with time stamps.
    - Be flexible. Some days you just don?t have it. **You are not a machine.** Of course, first you?ll take a walk and grab a double espresso or a Club Mate, but if that doesn?t work it?s okay. Go home. Go to the gym. Go play with your kid. Go kiting. Go for a walk in the forest. Anything, just don?t sit behind your desk to ?make the hours?. That?s not helping anybody.
    - Working at home vs. at Blendle HQ. Try to strike a **balance between home/office**. Meetings and brainstorms are best done face to face but a day of deep work is best done in a cafe or on an abandoned island with 4g.
    - **Rotate, change your pace.** During the summer it can be nice to start at 6:30 and bike to the beach at 15.00h. During the winter, every morning might feel like a small hangover and you stroll into HQ at 10:00 after your first 2 cups of coffee.
- **Take care of your body and mind**
    
    
    **Take holidays and days off.**

Content: - You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.
    
    **National Holidays**
    
    - **We stick to the commonly used national holidays** ~8 days per year.
    - This is a guideline.  If you have other national holidays you observe (eg Eid al-Fitr Suikerfeest, ending of Ramadan) feel free to work or be off when you want.
    
    **Working Hours & Life!**
    
    - Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.
    - Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.
- **This only works when**
    - Flexibility goes both ways.
    - You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.
    - You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.
- **Backdrop**
    
    The law and additional ruling tell us what we can and can not do according to time off. We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:

    Yes, as we now know there is a lot more to it than just taking holidays and working less. You could still feel stressed working 20 hours. Looking at the time spent on work and time spent on your personal life is a pretty good start and good for everybody (also when you don?t feel stressed. Let?s try to prevent it).
    
- **Take freedom and responsibility: find the right rhythm**
    
    
    We are a company with flexible working hours. This freedom comes with a responsibility. When we say that, a lot of people assume that they need to work a lot and really hard in exchange for that freedom. That is not what we are trying to say.

Content: **Food and exercise**
    
    Crucial to feeling well, is taking care of your body. Studies show that exercise is crucial when having a demanding job. That doesn?t mean we want you all to be fitgirls and fitboys. But: get moving. Go skating, hiking, biking, surfing, do yoga. Do something. Your body isn?t made to sit in a chair all day. Use the facilities at the office (standing desks and desk bikes) and try to go for a walk every day (is the 1on1-walk a thing yet?). The things you consume also affect this of course, no secrets there. Take care of yourself by consuming good stuff. No rocket science: just more veggies and water, less alcohol and smoking. Take care of yourself.
    
    **When something is wrong: go see a doctor:**
    
    Don?t wait too long to go see a doctor or therapist. It?s very normal to talk to a psychologist or coach every once in awhile. Just as normal as visiting a physiotherapist for back pain because you have an office job.
    
- **Setting priorities right and saying no (I know this is hard)**
    
    
    1. You, your family, friends and loved ones
    2. Blendle
    
    It?s important to know what the right order is. Your health comes first. Your loved ones come first. We want you to pay attention to your number 1 priority and have your private life in order. Because if it?s not, it will add to your stress level.

Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. 

Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. 

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. 

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. 

Six days ago, Russia?s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. 

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined.

**Snacks and more**

There will be beer, soda and snacks after All-hands presentations. 

On any other regular day:

- We might have chips etc, but op = op. We order snacks sometimes.
- This also goes for the cookies, fizzy drinks, beer or club mate.
- Fruit is something we want to provide everyday. If you notice we run out of fruit too fast and too often, ping our Office Manager so she can fix this.

If you are a big snack lover or don't want to be left empty-handed, consider bringing your own snacks.

---

**Clean up your shit**

You need to clean up your own shit. Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don't forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine. This 'system' works really well and keeps us away from bullshit like dishwasher duty.

Fahima is here every day, twice a day to clean this place, including toilets.

**Think about the environment.**

Kill the lights. Turn down the heating. Don't waste paper #deadtrees. We separate our garbage into paper, glass, plastics and rest. Don't waste food: feel free to take home bread on Friday.

    **Take holidays and days off.**
    
    This one seems obvious, but we know it?s not. We believe that working at Blendle is the Premier League, the creme de la creme :). That takes it?s toll and asks a lot from your body and mind. These two need time to recharge from your efforts. Make sure to build in moments of absolute rest during the year. It?s called a holiday. Make sure to take 4 weeks, and make sure at least 2 of those are in a row. Advice would be to really go away: studies show that this works best. There are some studies showing that taking regular holidays (every quarter) are very effective. So don?t wait 6 months to take 2 weeks. Also take a week every now and then.
    
    **Don?t work when you?re sick**
    
    When you have the flu, stay at home. Get back to work when you are fully recovered. Don?t feel guilty about it (easier said than done, we know). Yes we miss you, but we can do it without you for a few days. Even better: with you being away, your team might have to rethink how certain things are done in your absence. It can cause a new (maybe better) way for tasks and responsibilities to be distributed and single points of failure can be discovered and fixed.

But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. 

It?s based on DARPA?the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose?to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer?s, diabetes, and more. 

A unity agenda for the nation. 

We can do this. 

My fellow Americans?tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space?the citadel of our democracy. 

In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. 

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. 

And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. 

Now is the hour. 

Our moment of responsibility. 

Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. 

It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. 

Well I know this nation.

**Snacks and more**

There will be beer, soda and snacks after All-hands presentations. 

On any other regular day:

- We might have chips etc, but op = op. We order snacks sometimes.
- This also goes for the cookies, fizzy drinks, beer or club mate.
- Fruit is something we want to provide everyday. If you notice we run out of fruit too fast and too often, ping our Office Manager so she can fix this.

If you are a big snack lover or don't want to be left empty-handed, consider bringing your own snacks.

**Clean up your shit**

You need to clean up your own shit. Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don't forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine. This 'system' works really well and keeps us away from bullshit like dishwasher duty.

Fahima is here every day, twice a day to clean this place, including toilets.

**Think about the environment.**

Kill the lights. Turn down the heating. Don't waste paper #deadtrees. We separate our garbage into paper, glass, plastics and rest. Don't waste food: feel free to take home bread on Friday.

A lot of people are very eager to grow, to get better. Getting out of your comfort zone will help you do so. But pushing it too much will get you in the danger zone. Jean send me these circles a while back and I like how it illustrates the thin line between pushing it to grow vs. pushing too hard for too long.

Before we dig into all the different variables which can cause or relieve (and reload) stress, let?s talk about how to recognize when it is ?too much?.
